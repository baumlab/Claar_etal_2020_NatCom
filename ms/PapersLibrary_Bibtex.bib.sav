abstract = {The ongoing revolution in high-throughput sequencing continues to democratize the ability of small groups of investigators to map the microbial component of the biosphere. In particular, the coevolution of new sequencing platforms and new software tools allows data acquisition and analysis on an unprecedented scale. Here we report the next stage in this coevolutionary arms race, using the Illumina GAIIx platform to sequence a diverse array of 25 environmental samples and three known "mock communities" at a depth averaging 3.1 million reads per sample. We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diversity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of metaanalysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). We also demonstrate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recapture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. The results thus open up the possibility of conducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.},

abstract = {Generalized linear models provide a unified theoretical and conceptual framework for many of the most commonly used statistical methods. In the ten years since publication of the first edition of this bestselling text, great strides have been made in the development of new methods and in software for generalized linear models and other closely related models. Thoroughly revised and updated, An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition continues to initiate intermediate students of statistics, and the many other disciplines that use statistics, in the practical use of these models and methods. The new edition incorporates many of the important developments of the last decade, including survival analysis, nominal and ordinal logistic regression, generalized estimating equations, and multi-level models. It also includes modern methods for checking model adequacy and examples from an even wider range of application. Statistics can appear to the uninitiated as a collection of unrelated tools. An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition illustrates how these apparently disparate methods are examples or special cases of a conceptually simple structure based on the exponential family of distribution, maximum likelihood estimation, and the principles of statistical modelling.},

Recent studies focusing on this problem reveal that mass bleaching events have a strong periodic component, arising every ˜3--4 yr in step with the El Ni{\~n}o climatic phenomenon. To explore this possibility further, we examine a simple oceanographic‐ecological model designed to simulate the warm and cool phases of the Pacific Ocean cycle and gauge its effect on local coral reefs. This allows us to identify causes for localized `hot spots' in the ocean, whose high sea surface temperatures have disastrous consequences for corals. The underlying wave dynamics of the model lead to chaotic oscillations (every ˜3--4 yr), which help explain the coexistence of both order and irregularity in the dynamics of mass bleaching. The model makes use of a temperature threshold mechanism---a bleaching event is triggered whenever temperature anomalies exceed a critical...},

Bleaching is generally considered detrimental, but Buddemeier and Fautin have proposed that bleaching is also adaptive, providing an opportunity for recombining hosts with alternative algal types to form symbioses that might be better adapted to altered circumstances. Our mathematical model of this ``adaptive bleaching hypothesis'' provides insight into how animal-algae symbioses might react under various circumstances. It emulates many aspects of the coral bleaching phenomenon including: corals bleaching in response to a temperature only slightly greater than their average local maximum temperature; background bleaching; bleaching events being followed by bleaching of lesser magnitude in the subsequent one to several years; higher thermal tolerance of corals subject to environmental variability compared with those living under more constant conditions; patchiness in bleaching; and bleaching at temperatures that had not previously resulted in bleaching.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Coral reefs around the world are experiencing large-scale degradation, largely due to global climate change, overfishing, diseases and eutrophication. Climate change models suggest increasing frequency and severity of warming-induced coral bleaching events, with consequent increases in coral mortality and algal overgrowth. Critically, the recovery of damaged reefs will depend on the reversibility of seaweed blooms, generally considered to depend on grazing of the seaweed, and replenishment of corals by larvae that successfully recruit to damaged reefs. These processes usually take years to decades to bring a reef back to coral dominance.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:In 2006, mass bleaching of corals on inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef caused high coral mortality. Here we show that this coral mortality was followed by an unprecedented bloom of a single species of unpalatable seaweed (Lobophora variegata), colonizing dead coral skeletons, but that corals on these reefs recovered dramatically, in less than a year. Unexpectedly, this rapid reversal did not involve reestablishment of corals by recruitment of coral larvae, as often assumed, but depended on several ecological mechanisms previously underestimated.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:These mechanisms of ecological recovery included rapid regeneration rates of remnant coral tissue, very high competitive ability of the corals allowing them to out-compete the seaweed, a natural seasonal decline in the particular species of dominant seaweed, and an effective marine protected area system. Our study provides a key example of the doom and boom of a highly resilient reef, and new insights into the variability and mechanisms of reef resilience under rapid climate change.},

Urchins later showed increased abundance on dead coral colonies and frameworks, and caused bioerosion that exceeded the net calcification capacity of disturbed reefs. Known human impacts on corals result mainly from anchor damage, the collection of corals for sale as curios, and mechanical damage resulting from the activities of fishermen. An evaluation of natural and anthropogenic damage to Gal{\'a}pagos coral communities indicates that natural disturbances, especially strong ENSO episodes, are of greatest concern. However, rapidly increasing human pressures could exacerbate the recovery capacity of naturally perturbed coral communities.},

abstract = {Few studies of microbial biogeography address variability across both multiple habitats and multiple seasons. Here we examine the spatial and temporal variability of bacterioplankton community composition of the Columbia River coastal margin using 16S amplicon pyrosequencing of 300 water samples collected in 2007 and 2008. Communities separated into seven groups (ANOSIM, P<0.001): river, estuary, plume, epipelagic, mesopelagic, shelf bottom (depth<350 m) and slope bottom (depth>850 m). The ordination of these samples was correlated with salinity ($\rho$=-0.83) and depth ($\rho$=-0.62). Temporal patterns were obscured by spatial variability among the coastal environments, and could only be detected within individual groups. Thus, structuring environmental factors (for example, salinity, depth) dominate over seasonal changes in determining community composition. Seasonal variability was detected across an annual cycle in the river, estuary and plume where communities separated into two groups, early year (April-July) and late year (August-Nov), demonstrating annual reassembly of communities over time. Determining both the spatial and temporal variability of bacterioplankton communities provides a framework for modeling these communities across environmental gradients from river to deep ocean.},

abstract = {This study quantifies the relative contributions of autotrophy and heterotrophy to the energy budget of the temperate scleractinian species Cladocora caespitosa Linnaeus 1767. Colonies were incubated under different light and feeding regimes, and changes in carbon acquisition through photosynthesis and feeding were measured during a 2-month time period. This approach allowed us to quantify the rate at which adjustments to physiology occurred, as well as the magnitude of up- or downregulation of both feeding modes. In addition, we explored how shifts in carbon acquisition mode influenced tissue biomass (protein content), energy stores (lipid content) and colony growth (calcification). Increases in feeding capacity during prolonged exposure to darkness were correlated with decreases in photosynthetic capacity. However, feeding effort did not decrease when photosynthesis was high. In fact, feeding was maximal under high light conditions when food was not available. During starvation, colonies used their lipid stores to partially meet their metabolic requirements. Colonies kept in low light used nutrients from feeding to supplement calcification, whereas those kept at high light converted carbon from feeding into tissue biomass. This work provides the first estimates of rates of adjustment of heterotrophic feeding capacity in a Mediterranean scleractinian coral. For the study species, flexibility in carbon acquisition through heterotrophy was approximately equal to flexibility in photosynthesis both in magnitude and in the rate at which physiological adjustments occurred. The ability to alter feeding effort rapidly and strongly may explain the wide depth distribution of C. caespitosa, and its ability to survive in turbid coastal waters where light is often limited.},

Summary: Seasonality of symbiont mitotic index and expulsion rates in temperate corals

Question: Do corals acclimatize to environmental conditions by changing expulsion rates during different seasons?

Methods:
Cell counts
Mitotic index (percentage of mitotic cells in a sample)

Results:
"While zooxanthellae MI was independent of symbiont density, expulsion rates were significantly density dependent"

Summary: Monitored the standing stock and release of zooxanthellae under N enrichment

Question:

Methods:

Results: N-enriched corals had 3x more algal standing stock, but a reduced rate of photosynthate transfer to the host
"N enrichment more than doubled algal densities in this coral indicating that zooxanthellae in situ may be nutrient limited and that algal densities are, to some extent, a function of nutrient levels in the external environment and not entirely regulated by the host."
"That is, what sets algal density in host cells is, in part, nutrient availability or competition among algal cells for nutrients. The nutrient availability in host cells, in turn, evidently responds to changes in nutrient concentration in the external environment. Thus, algal densities may not be simply regulated by the host, but may also reflect nutrient availability in the external environment."

Summary: Used PAM to investigate photosynthetic efficiency of Symbio from several species under temperature stress.

Question: Why do some organisms bleach while others do not?

Methods: PAM fluormetry, and whole cell fluorescence of freshly isolated zoox

Results:
<b>"We have identified fundamental differences in the physiology of the symbionts within different species of coral."</b>
"Zooxanthellae within M annular is appear to be more susceptible to heat-induced damage at or near the reaction centre of Photosystem II, while zooxanthellae living in S. radians remain capable of dissipating excess excitation energy through non-photochemical pathways, thereby protecting the photosystem from damage during heat exposure."

Summary: Transplantation and experimental manipulation of Acropora millepora to test if increased thermal tolerance a) existed and b) was use to changes in symbiont type (C -{\&}gt; D)

Question: Can a change in symbiont type increase thermal tolerance?

Methods:
Lab experiment - manipulated temperature
ITS1
Zooxanthella counts and fluorescence

Results:
Increased thermal tolerance as a direct result of the change in symbiont type (shuffling)
the potential for change in algal symbionts may be population specific
Supports ABH (but not all populations appear to have the ability to switch)
"Corals harbouring mixed symbiont populations are likely to have a distinct ecological advantage over those that do not, in term of their ability to cope and respond rapidly to thermal stress events."

abstract = {The ability of coral reefs to survive the projected increases in temperature due to global warming will depend largely on the ability of corals to adapt or acclimatize to increased temperature extremes over the next few decades. Many coral species are highly sensitive to temperature stress and the number of stress (bleaching) episodes has increased in recent decades. We investigated the acclimatization potential of Acropora millepora, a common and widespread Indo-Pacific hard coral species, through transplantation and experimental manipulation. We show that adult corals, at least in some circumstances, are capable of acquiring increased thermal tolerance and that the increased tolerance is a direct result of a change in the symbiont type dominating their tissues from Symbiodinium type C to D. Our data suggest that the change in symbiont type in our experiment was due to a shuffling of existing types already present in coral tissues, not through exogenous uptake from the environment. The level of increased tolerance gained by the corals changing their dominant symbiont type to D (the most thermally resistant type known) is around 1-1.5 degrees C. This is the first study to show that thermal acclimatization is causally related to symbiont type and provides new insight into the ecological advantage of corals harbouring mixed algal populations. While this increase is of huge ecological significance for many coral species, in the absence of other mechanisms of thermal acclimatization/adaptation, it may not be sufficient to survive climate change under predicted sea surface temperature scenarios over the next 100 years. However, it may be enough to 'buy time' while greenhouse reduction measures are put in place.},

The first part of the book introduces the essential underpinnings of molecular ecology and gives a review of genetics and discussion of the molecular markers that are most frequently used in ecological research, and a chapter devoted to the newly emerging field of ecological genomics. The second half of the book covers specific applications of molecular ecology, covering phylogeography, behavioural ecology and conservation genetics. The new edition provides a thoroughly up-to-date introduction to the field, emphasising new types of analyses and including current examples and techniques whilst also retaining the information-rich, highly readable style which set the first edition apart. Incorporates both theoretical and applied perspectives Highly accessible, user-friendly approach and presentation Includes self-assessment activities with hypothetical cases based on actual species and realistic data sets Uses case studies to place the theory in context Provides coverage of population genetics, genomics, phylogeography, behavioural ecology and conservation genetics.},

Summary: Survey of Symbiodinium diversity in two pools of varying temperature in American Samoa

Question: Are putatively temperature-resistant symbionts more commonly found in hotter environments?

Methods: 
Cp23 sequencing
ITS1

Results:
"1) In a high temperature habitat in American Samoa, most of the surveyed corals host multiple symbiont types, including a putatively thermally resistant member of Symbiodinium clade D
2) Among corals that host multiple symbionts, most show higher proportions of this clade D symbiont in the hotter habitat
**3) Even corals that host members of both of the very distinct clades C and D show strong preference, if not specificity, for specific members of clade C"**

Question: Do P and R rates vary between host species (with different symbiont types)?

Methods:
ITS1
SSCP
O2 microelectrodes

Results:
"environmental conditions coupled with regional-scale distribution of Symbiodinium are likely to exert important influences on respiration and photosynthetic performance of reef-building corals."
"Our results suggest that photosynthesis and dark respiration of corals are influenced by a combination of environmental conditions as well as adaptive traits of the holobiont such as the Symbiodinium type hosted."
No regional-scale differences in photosynthesis and dark respiration in winter, but differences in summer

Summary: Review of symbiodinium adaptation knowledge, describes the adaptive bleaching hypothesis and what research would need to be done to test it 

Question: What do we know about the dynamics of symbiosis, and how would we test the idea that bleaching is an adaptive mechanism?

Methods:

Results:
"Rather than an absence of specificity between partners, out hypothesis posits that specificity changes as environmental conditions do. THus, although bleaching may represent instability in the short term, it promotes long-term stability by enhancing survival chances of both zooxanthellae and hosts under conditions that are not those of the prestress environment. Potential hosts and habitats are many, so the combination of environmental variability and symbiotic adaptation acts o conserve both genetic and symbiotic diversity"

Problems:

Impressions: 
Interesting - "Studies must include the complete spectrum of red-dwelling symbiotic units, because scleractinian corals may acquire zooxanthellae from host organisms of other taxa" Has anyone actually done this?
"The rapid potential generation time of zooxanthellae compared with that of most hosts might appear to make them (and hence their symbiotic units) evolutionarily more responsive to local conditions than the hosts" but{\ldots} "the probable evolutionary stasis of both host and symbiont may be compensated for by the creation of new symbiotic units through recombining symbiotic partners"},

"It is unknown what circumstances allow for the initial uptake of clade D in individual corals, but evidence points to life-stage and environmental conditions as important factors. Perhaps it takes several generations for clade D to integrate into a host endosymbiotic com- munity, and it is an event that only occurs when stressful conditions occur at a specific point during the integration process."

Summary: Development of a new method for Symbiodinium detection

Question: What is the incidence of mixed infections of Symbiodinium in cnidarian hosts (anemones)?

Methods:
QPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction)
FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization)

Results:
Prevalence of mixed infection detection in the sea anemone Condylactis gigantia = 40%, with this method was 80-90%
Hosts that were previously described as universally unialgal bore up tp 1.6% of the alternate clade
"Results of the many studies on the geographical distribution and host specificity of Symbdiodinium that are passed on PCR-RFLP analyses should be treated as indicative, but not definitive, of the full Symbiodinium clade diversity."

abstract = {The dinoflagellate microalga Symbiodinium is the dominant algal symbiont in corals and related marine animals. To explore the incidence of mixed infections, methods employing real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were developed. In experiments focusing on Symbiodinium clades A and B, QPCR and FISH results were well correlated and generally more precise and sensitive than those from the endpoint PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) traditionally used for this application, thus increasing the detected incidence of mixed infections. For example, the prevalence of mixed infections in the sea anemone Condylactis gigantea was 40% by PCR-RFLP and 80%-90% by QPCR and FISH. However, the use of QPCR and FISH was limited by inter-host variation in the rRNA gene copy number per Symbiodinium cell, precluding any single conversion factor between QPCR signal and Symbiodinium cell number; and one FISH probe that gave excellent hybridization efficiency with cultured Symbiodinium yielded variable results with Symbiodinium from symbioses. After controlling for these caveats, QPCR studies revealed that field-collected hosts previously described as universally unialgal bore up to 1.6% of the alternative clade. Further research is required to establish the contribution that algal cells at low density in symbiosis and external to the symbiosis make to the minor clade.},

Molecular Ecology 13:2445-2458

Summary: Looked at an open-water area and a warmer (well-connected) lake for differences in symbiodinium diversities.

Question: Are there different symbiodinium communities in response to bleaching, temperature, and shading history?

Methods:
Response - genetic identity and diversity
Factors - bleaching mortality, water temperature, and shading

Results:
"Whole coral assemblages, when growing in elevated seawater temperatures and at a reduced irradiance, can be composed of colonies associated with the more thermo-tolerant clade D zooxanthellae."
"Future increases in seawater temperature might, therefore, result in an increasing prevalence of Symbiodinium phylotype D in scleractinian corals, possibly associated with a loss of diversity in both zooxanthellae and corals."
"Partly due to the low level of replication, a majority of the 39 coral species appeared to be exclusively associated with either clade C or D. However, a total of 30% of species from which more than one colony was tested (6 of 20) were found to vary between clades C and D."
Found a decrease in diversity in both coral and zooxanthellae communities in the warmer lake area.
Some clade C did survive, so "if adaptation should indeed occur, it could be a slow process: a better adapted (and reduced set of genotypes might gradually establish through series of extensive sublethal bleaching events that remove the maladapted zooxanthella genotypes and coral species."

Problems:
They name the symbiont types funny, and group ones that they aren't sure of (their reason is that they don't want to make it more confusing)
They have a lot of potential reasons for why the community is different in the lake, but none of them are bulletproof

abstract = {The potential of corals to associate with more temperature-tolerant strains of algae (zooxanthellae, Symbiodinium) can have important implications for the future of coral reefs in an era of global climate change. In this study, the genetic identity and diversity of zooxanthellae was investigated at three reefs with contrasting histories of bleaching mortality, water temperature and shading, in the Republic of Palau (Micronesia). Single-stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 region was used for genotyping. A chronically warm but partly shaded coral reef in a marine lake that is hydrographically well connected to the surrounding waters harboured only two single-stranded conformation polymorphism profiles (i.e. zooxanthella communities). It consisted only of Symbiodinium D in all 13 nonporitid species and two Porites species investigated, with the remaining five Porites harbouring C*. Despite the high temperature in this lake (> 0.5 degrees above ambient), this reef did not suffer coral mortality during the (1998) bleaching event, however, no bleaching-sensitive coral families and genera occur in the coral community. This setting contrasts strongly with two other reefs with generally lower temperatures, in which 10 and 12 zooxanthella communities with moderate to low proportions of clade D zooxanthellae were found. The data indicate that whole coral assemblages, when growing in elevated seawater temperatures and at reduced irradiance, can be composed of colonies associated with the more thermo-tolerant clade D zooxanthellae. Future increases in seawater temperature might, therefore, result in an increasing prevalence of Symbiodinium phylotype D in scleractinian corals, possibly associated with a loss of diversity in both zooxanthellae and corals.},

Summary: Stressed corals to bleach, and then measured what zooxanthellae came back afterwards

Question: What happens to Symbiodinium communities after a pulse stress event?

Methods: Field experiments - reduced {\#} of zooxanthellae (by transplanting to shallow water or by shading, and then allowed them to recover.
RFLPof srDNA
Monitored zooxanthellae after until 9 months

Results:
After depletion (not extreme) corals had the same types of zooxanthellae.
After depletion (extreme) always populated with zooxanthellae atypical for their habitat
"coral-zooxanthella associations may or may not be re-established following disturbance, depending on the magnitude of zooxanthellae depletion"
"A reservoir of adjacent zooxanthellae, whether Symbio C or B, is not sufficient to prevent the establishment of new host-zooxanthella associations in bleached tissues."
Didn't see succession back to B or C (but see **)
Also looked at Symbio communities in corals with Yellow blotch disease

Problems:
With this method, an smDNA genotype mud be at least 5% of the total to be detected reliably..that means that it is impossible to know whether these new Symbio were taken up from the environment, or if they were present already in very low densities before bleaching.
** They had bleaching occurring during their "recovery" time

Impressions: 
First study to look at Symbiodinium recovery in uncharacterized natural populations of Symbio
Interesting that they had similar Symbio population structure changes for both low light treatments and high light treatments - implying that these might not necessarily be picked up because the are good, but because they are opportunistic

To investigate the resilience of these host-zooxanthella associations, we conducted field experiments in which we experimentally reduced the numbers of zooxanthellae (by transplanting to shallow water or by shading) and then allowed treated corals to recover. When depletion was not extreme, recovering corals generally contained the same types of zooxanthellae as they did prior to treatment. After severe depletion, however, recovering corals were always repopulated by zooxanthellae atypical for their habitat (and in some cases atypical for the coral species). These unusual zooxanthellar associations were often (but not always) established in experimentally bleached tissues even when adjacent tissues were untreated. Atypical zooxanthellae were also observed in bleached tissues of unmanipulated Montastraea with yellow-blotch disease. In colonies where unusual associations were established, the original taxa of zooxanthellae were not detected even 9 months after the end of treatment. These observations suggest that zooxanthellae in Montastraea range from fugitive opportunists and stress-tolerant generalists (Symbiodinium A and E) to narrowly adapted specialists (Symbiodinium B and C), and may undergo succession.},

Summary: A community ecology approach to the study of Symbiodinium in the broader Caribbean.
"This is the first stuy to examine the diversity and community structure of Symbidoinium spp populations over an entire coral reef invertebrate assemblage."

Question:

Methods:
ITS2
Sampled scleractinians, hydrozoans (Millepora), scyphozoans (Cassiopeia), actinarians, zooanthids, corralimorphs, gorgonians, queen conch

Results:
"The reef-wide community distribution of these symbionts is dominated by a few types found in many different host taxa, while numerous rare types appear to have high specificity for a particular host species or genus."
"A comparison of the symbiont types found in field-collected hosts with types preciously cultured from these hosts indicates the existence of low density or "background"-symbiont populations and cryptic potentially non-mutualistic types in some hosts."
Found depth relationships: lineage A are major components of shallow assemblages, but absent under 5m. Also differences in C1 and C3 types.
"Niche diversification through the formation of specific partnerships may create and maintain symbiont diversity. While there is no evidence of long-term coevolution between partners, there is a possibility that short-term coevolutionary processes during periods of relative stability may drive speciation, as data from the ITS region indicate."

"A clarification should be made between Symbiodinium spp. that are truly :cryptic: and symtions that dominate the mutualistic symbiont populations in some hosts but persist in other hosts at very low densities."
"A central question concerning coral reef ecosystem health is how these important symbiotic associations might adjust to environmental change. A greater understanding of Symbiodinium spa community ecology and diversity, and the mechanisms governing host-symbiont specificity, can help in predicting how these systems will change with the climate."

Growth of these injured nubbins was examined in parallel, and compared to controls. Biochemical compositions of the holobiont and the zooxanthellae density were determined at the onset of the experiment, and the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm ) of zooxanthellae was monitored during the experiment. Acropora muricata rapidly regenerated small lesions, but regeneration rates significantly differed between sites. At the sheltered site characterized by high temperatures, temperature variations, and irradiance levels, regeneration took 192 days on average. At the exposed site, characterized by steadier temperatures and lower irradiation, nubbins demonstrated fast lesion repair (81 days), slower growth, lower zooxanthellae density, chlorophyll a concentration and lipid content than at the former site. A trade-off between growth and regeneration rates was evident here. High growth rates seem to impair regeneration capacity. We show that environmental conditions conducive to high zooxanthellae densities in corals are related to fast skeletal growth but also to reduced lesion regeneration rates. We hypothesize that a lowered regenerative capacity may be related to limited availability of energetic and cellular resources, consequences of coral holobionts operating at high levels of photosynthesis and associated growth.},

abstract = {The impact of physico-chemical factors on percent coral cover and coral health was examined on a spatial basis for two dominant Acropora species, A. digitifera and A. spicifera, at Ningaloo Reef (north-western Australia) in the southeast Indian Ocean. Coral health was investigated by measuring metabolic indices (RNA/DNA ratio and protein concentration), energy levels (lipid ratio) and autotrophic indices (chlorophyll a (chl a) and zooxanthellae density) at six stations during typical seasons (austral autumn 2010 (March and April), austral winter 2010 (August)) and during an extreme La Ni{\~n}a event in summer 2011 (February). These indices were correlated with 15 physico-chemical factors (measured immediately following coral sampling) to identify predictors for health indices. Variations in metabolic indices (protein concentration and RNA/DNA ratio) for A. spicifera were mainly explained by nitrogen, temperature and zooplankton concentrations under typical conditions, while for A. digitifera, light as well as phytoplankton, in particular picoeukaryotes, were important, possibly due to higher energy requirement for lipid synthesis and storage in A. digitifera. Optimum metabolic values occurred for both Acropora species at 26-28$\,^{\circ}$C when autotrophic indices (chl a and zooxanthellae density) were lowest. The extreme temperature during the La Ni{\~n}a event resulted in a shift of feeding modes, with an increased importance of water column plankton concentrations for metabolic rates of A. digitifera and light and plankton for A. spicifera. Our results suggest that impacts of high sea surface temperatures during extreme events such as La Ni{\~n}a may be mitigated via reduction on metabolic rates in coral host. The high water column plankton concentrations and associated low light levels resulted in a shift towards high symbiont densities, with lower metabolic rates and energy levels than the seasonal norm for the coral host.},

abstract = {Increases in Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) as a result of global warming have caused reef-building scleractinian corals to bleach worldwide, a result of the loss of obligate endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. Since the 1980's, bleaching severity and frequency has increased, in some cases causing mass mortality of corals. Earlier experiments have demonstrated that zooxanthellae in scleractinian corals from three families from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia (Faviidae, Poritidae, and Acroporidae) are more sensitive to heat stress than their hosts, exhibiting differential symptoms of programmed cell death - apoptosis and necrosis. Most zooxanthellar phylotypes are dying during expulsion upon release from the host. The host corals appear to be adapted or exapted to the heat increases. We attempt to determine whether this adaptation/exaptation occurs in octocorals by examining the heat-sensitivities of zooxanthellae and their host octocoral alcyonacean soft corals - Sarcophyton ehrenbergi (Alcyoniidae), Sinularia lochmodes (Alcyoniidae), and Xenia elongata (Xeniidae), species from two different families. The soft coral holobionts were subjected to experimental seawater temperatures of 28, 30, 32, 34, and 36$\,^{\circ}$C for 48 hrs. Host and zooxanthellar cells were examined for viability, apoptosis, and necrosis (in hospite and expelled) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescent microscopy (FM), and flow cytometry (FC). As experimental temperatures increased, zooxanthellae generally exhibited apoptotic and necrotic symptoms at lower temperatures than host cells and were expelled. Responses varied species-specifically. Soft coral hosts were adapted/exapted to higher seawater temperatures than their zooxanthellae. As with the scleractinians, the zooxanthellae appear to be the limiting factor for survival of the holobiont in the groups tested, in this region. These limits have now been shown to operate in six species within five families and two orders of the Cnidaria in the western Pacific. We hypothesize that this relationship may have taxonomic implications for other obligate zooxanthellate cnidarians subject to bleaching.},

abstract = {Research has generated a number of advances in methods for spatial cluster modelling in recent years, particularly in the area of Bayesian cluster modelling. Along with these advances has come an explosion of interest in the potential applications of this work, especially in epidemiology and genome research. In one integrated volume, this book reviews the state-of-the-art in spatial clustering and spatial cluster modelling, bringing together research and applications previously scattered throughout the literature. It begins with an overview of the field, then presents a series of chapters that illuminate the nature and purpose of cluster modelling within different application areas, including astrophysics, epidemiology, ecology, and imaging. The focus then shifts to methods, with discussions on point and object process modelling, perfect sampling of cluster processes, partitioning in space and space-time, spatial and spatio-temporal process modelling, nonparametric methods for clustering, and spatio-temporal cluster modelling. Many figures, some in full color, complement the text, and a single section of references cited makes it easy to locate source material. Leading specialists in the field of cluster modelling authored each chapter, and an introduction by the editors to each chapter provides a cohesion not typically found in contributed works. Spatial Cluster Modelling thus offers a singular opportunity to explore this exciting new field, understand its techniques, and apply them in your own research.},

abstract = {Despite its supreme importance and the threat of its global crash, biodiversity remains poorly understood both empirically and theoretically. This ambitious book presents a new, general neutral theory to explain the origin, maintenance, and loss of biodiversity in a biogeographic context. Until now biogeography (the study of the geographic distribution of species) and biodiversity (the study of species richness and relative species abundance) have had largely disjunct intellectual histories. In this book, Stephen Hubbell develops a formal mathematical theory that unifies these two fields. When a speciation process is incorporated into Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson's now classical theory of island biogeography, the generalized theory predicts the existence of a universal, dimensionless biodiversity number. In the theory, this fundamental biodiversity number, together with the migration or dispersal rate, completely determines the steady-state distribution of species richness and relative species abundance on local to large geographic spatial scales and short-term to evolutionary time scales. Although neutral, Hubbell's theory is nevertheless able to generate many nonobvious, testable, and remarkably accurate quantitative predictions about biodiversity and biogeography. In many ways Hubbell's theory is the ecological analog to the neutral theory of genetic drift in genetics. The unified neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity should stimulate research in new theoretical and empirical directions by ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and biogeographers.},

abstract = {The widespread replacement of native species with cosmopolitan, nonnative species is homogenizing the global fauna and flora. While the empirical study of biotic homogenization is substantial and growing, theoretical aspects have yet to be explored. Consequently, the breadth of possible ecological mechanisms that can shape current and future patterns and rates of homogenization remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a conceptual model that describes 14 potential scenarios by which species invasions and/or extinctions can lead to various trajectories of biotic homogenization (increased community similarity) or differentiation (decreased community similarity); we then use a simulation approach to explore the model's predictions. We found changes in community similarity to vary with the type and number of nonnative and native species, the historical degree of similarity among the communities, and, to a lesser degree, the richness of the recipient communities. Homogenization is greatest when similar species invade communities, causing either no extinction or differential extinction of native species. The model predictions are consistent with current empirical data for fish, bird, and plant communities and therefore may represent the dominant mechanisms of contemporary homogenization. We present a unifying model illustrating how the balance between invading and extinct species dictates the outcome of biotic homogenization. We conclude by discussing a number of critical but largely unrecognized issues that bear on the empirical study of biotic homogenization, including the importance of spatial scale, temporal scale, and data resolution. We argue that the study of biotic homogenization needs to be placed in a more mechanistic and predictive framework in order for studies to provide adequate guidance in conservation efforts to maintain regional distinctness of the global biota.},

Fagoonee Wilson Hassell and Turner 1999
Science 283(5403): 843-845

Summary: 6 years of weekly Symbiodinium density counts, compared to environmental parameters

Question: What is the natural variability of Symbiodinium densities under fluctuating environmental conditions?

Methods: Symbio counts from Acropora, water quality testing, used multiple regression analysis to determine significant terms

Results: Found that explanatory variables were 1) Time of Year, 2) Temperature, 3) Dissolved oxygen concentrations, 4) Nitrate, 5) Phosphate (full model accounts for 40% of variability in density)
Nitrogen limited zooxanthellae??

Problems:

Impressions: Using a multiple regression with zooxanthellae density with environmental predictors (could I use this for the Waiopae analyses? Doesn't this cause problems with temporal autocorrelation?)},

Summary:

Question:
1) What is the exposure time (to nutrient enrichment) needed to induce measurable change in growth rate?
2) Which are the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus required to cause changes in these rates?
3) What is the recovery potential of the corals after the nutrient stress?

Methods: N, NP, P enrichments in mesocosms; response = coral growth rate (measured by buoyant weight of the nubbins)

Results:
Decrease in growth rate was rapid following nutrient enrichment
"Corals with the highest % increases in max gross photosynthetic rate had the smalls decreases in growth rate due to nutrient enrichment."
"High ammonia and relatively low phosphorus concentrations are required t induce a significant decrease in coral growth rate."

Summary:

Question:

Methods:
Flowthrough aquaria (Lab)
Measured calcification rates (Ca45)
Tissue protein content per polyp
Took many samples throughout the year between 1991 and 2001

Results:
"Temperature affects some fundamental process of calcification that is independent of light effects."
Since light can have no effect on the calcification rate of Dendrophyllia, the change in rate must be indisputably due to temperature change.
"Calcification rates decreased rapidly at temperatures approaching the summer maximum and this may have implications fro coral growth in felation to increasing sea temperatures as a consequence of global climate change."
Problems:

Impressions: Seems interesting to me to compare a zooxanthellate and an azooxanthellate coral to look at calcification rates. I guess I don't' know enough about calcification rates, but I thought that the mechanisms would be very different since Symbiodinium really influence calcification in their hosts.

Important to consider if you conclude that temperature affects calcification. Because it gives another mechanism in that it is independent of Symbiodinium function (which is what is generally considered to contribute to decreased calcification rates under increased temperatures.},

Models were built to assess future trajectories. They assumed variable coral types (slow/fast growing), disturbance frequencies (5,10,20 years), mortality (equal or not), and connectivity (un/connected to un/disturbed community). Known disturbances were used to parameterize models. Present and future disturbances were estimated from remote-sensing chlorophyll and temperature data. Simulations and sensitivity analysis suggest community resilience at >20-year disturbance frequency, but degradation at higher frequency. Trajectories move from fast-grower to slow-grower dominance at intermediate disturbance frequency, then again to fast-grower dominance. A similar succession was observed in the field: Acropora to Porites to Stylophora/Pocillopora dominance on shallow reefs, and a transition from large poritids to small faviids on deep reefs. Synthesis and application: Even distant reefs are impacted by global changes. COTS impacts and bleaching were key driver of coral degradation, coral population decline could be reduced if these outbreaks and bleaching susceptibility were managed by maintaining water quality and by other interventions. Just leaving reefs alone, seems no longer a satisfactory option.},

Question: Does the presence of symbionts affect the accuracy of Sr/Ca paleotemperatures?

However, these estimates are disputed, because uptake of Sr into coral skeleton is thought to be affected by algal symbionts (zooxanthellae) living in the host tissue. Here, we show that significant distortion of the Sr/Ca temperature record in coral skeleton occurs in the presence of algal symbionts. Seasonally resolved Sr/Ca in coral without symbionts reflects local SSTs with a temperature sensitivity equivalent to that of laboratory aragonite precipitated at equilibrium and the nighttime skeletal deposits of symbiotic reef corals. However, up to 65% of the Sr/Ca variability in symbiotic skeleton is related to symbiont activity and does not reflect water temperature.},

Indices are divided between factors known to stress corals, and factors incorporating properties of the reef landscape that resist stress or promote coral growth. The first-basis for a remote sensed resilience index (RSRI), an estimate of expected reef resilience, is proposed. Developed for the Red Sea, the framework of our analysis is flexible and with minimal adaptation, could be extended to other reef regions.

The loss of color was due to the mass expulsion of zooxanthellae from the tissues of Millepora, Scleractinia, Zoanthidea, and Actiniaria living in the shallow reef zones. The polyps of the bleached individuals continued to expand and feed in their normal fashion. It is believed that expulsion of the zooxanthellae was induced by contact with water of lowered osmotic pressure on the surface of the sea, rather than by sedimentation or fouling. Regeneration of the depleted zooxanthellar populations was very slow; many of the bleached colonies survived well despite the near total absence of zooxanthellae from their tissues for over 2 months.},

Summary: Looked at Acroporids at several reef locations, an in sun-exposed and shaded pats of each coral colony

Question:

Methods:
QPCR with Taqman fluorogenic probes

Results:
"The results show that the distribution of genetically distinct zooxanthellae is correlated with light regime and possibly temperature in some (but not all) colonies of A tennis and A valid and at some reef locations, which we interpret as acclimation to local environmental conditions"
"The abundance of clade D vs. clade C in A valid colonies in Pioneer Bay is stringy correlated with the ambient light regime across colonies, which suggests that the two clades exhibit some degree of niche partitioning depending on the light climate across individual colonies and on the particular photosynthetic characteristics of the algae involved."
"{\ldots}clade C could be characterized as "light loving" and clade D as "shade-loving genotypes of Symbiodinium in A. valida. However, other environmental factors, such as temperature or nutrition, may play a role as well." (and{\ldots}.they found that the water where D was tended to be warmer than the ones where C was)
"The results obtained here suggest that preference to light is likely to be genetically determined and that sybionts belonging to clade C are more light-loving than those belonging to clade D, and within clade C, Symbiodinium C2 is more light-loving than Symbiodinium C1. However, other environmental factors, such as temperature or nutrients, may play an important role in the distribution of Symbiodinium strains as well."

Summary: "the fluorescent pigments of corals provide a photo biological system for regulating the light environment of coral host tissue."

Question:

Methods: Fluorescent and non-fluorescent
Confocal microscopy
Responses: chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm, PAM), Symbiodinium biomass

Results:
Non-fluorescent morphs were more photo inhibited than fluorescent morphs
Fluorescent proteins might affect susceptibility to bleaching
"The most pigmented, and most re ̄ective, parts of coloniesÐ{\textregistered}rst, branch tips and colony edges, and second, the oral disk/cone and tentacle tips, which on polyp retraction form a sun-screening polyp `plug'7 (Fig. 4c)Ðcorrespond respectively to known areas of highest cell division and areas immediately above reproductive organs. This distribution points to a photoprotective role of FPs in screening sensitive coral tissues as well as symbionts."
"n high-light-acclimated corals, FPs are localized above the endosym- bionts (Fig. 4a$\pm$c), and are in a position to screen them from excess sunlight. In shade-adapted corals from light-limited habitats, FPs are localized endodermally, among or below the layers of endo- symbionts (Fig. 4d), consistent with their proposed function of light enhancement for photosynthesis by way of wavelength-transforma- tion and back-scattering4,5."

Knowlton and Rohwer (2003)
Am Nat 162(S4):S51-S62

Summary: Coral associated microbes are common, diverse, and we know almost nothing about them.

Question:

Methods:

Results:
"Because clade C dominates Pacific corals and contains the largest number of variants, intraclade diversity is likely to be more important in the Pacific than in the Caribbean, although few surveys address this point"
"Our knowledge of the nature of the diversity of bacterial and archaeal associates of corals is so sketchy that it is difficult to draw general conclusions about how their dis- tribution patterns vary biogeographically and across eco- logical gradients."
"Essentially nothing is known about distributions along environmental gradients for these bacteria, but there are tantalizing hints of what might emerge with further study."

Questions:
"1. How much ecologically significant variation in zooxanthellae remains to be discovered? Are there broadly generalist species or does variation yet to be discovered map finely onto host species or environmental characteristics (e.g., Santos and Coffroth 2003)?
2. Where are the free-living zooxanthellae, and how important is the free-living stage to our understanding of coral-zooxanthella symbiosis? In particular, does spatial variation in community composition of symbionts within hosts reflect to some extent the local community of free- living symbionts?
3. Why do some coral species host a single type of zooxanthella, while other coral species host multiple types? In the latter group, why do some species exhibit within- colony diversity and others only between-colony diversity?
4. Why are the Caribbean and Pacific so different with respect to the relative abundance of different zooxanthellar clades, and do these differences have implications for how these reef systems function (e.g., for their vulnerability to bleaching; LaJeunesse et al. 2003)?
5. What is the history of the diversification of Symbiodinium? How old are the groups of zooxanthellae, and was diversification a response to past environmental variation (e.g., in the Caribbean; LaJeunesse et al. 2003)?
6. How do zooxanthellar clades and types within clades differ in their physiology and ecology? Does the host also
play a major role in determining the ecology of the resulting partnership, as suggested by some studies (Loya et al. 2001; Brown et al. 2002b)?
7. Do different types of zooxanthellae differ in their mutualistic behavior, and are there cheating zooxanthellae? 8. What are the relative roles of the host (through selectivity) and symbiont (through differences in competitive ability, colonization ability, and stress resistance) in modulating zooxanthellar distributions? In coral bleaching, for example, do corals selectively expel nonperforming zoo- xanthellae and/or do zooxanthellae abandon corals understress? 9. What is the nature of the biochemical ``conversation''
(e.g., see Hirsch and McFall-Ngai 2000) that modulates coral-zooxanthella interactions? Can compartmentaliza- tion of one or a few zooxanthellae within individual host cells help the host maintain the mutualistic character of the association, as suggested by theory (e.g., Hoeksema and Kummel 2003)? Could the absence of such compart- mentalization (e.g., the bacteria in the coral mucous layer) make associations more unstable as mutualisms?
10. What is the scope of diversity for coral-associated bacteria and Archaea, and how is it patterned in space and time?
11. Which of the many bacterial and archaeal associates of corals are true mutualists, and what roles do they play? 12. How important are bacterial and archaeal com- munities to the health of coral reefs, and are they being disrupted by anthropogenic stress? Answers to these questions are of intrinsic interest to any student of mutualisms and may also help to ensure that coral reefs survive into the next century (Knowlton 2001)."

abstract = {Reef-building corals associate with a diverse array of eukaryotic and noneukaryotic microbes. Best known are dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium ("zooxanthellae"), which are photosynthetic symbionts found in all reef-building corals. Once considered a single species, they are now recognized as several large, genetically diverse groups that often co-occur within a single host species or colony. Variation among Symbiodinium in host identities, tolerance to stress, and ability to colonize hosts has been documented, but there is little information on the ecology of zooxanthellar free-living stages and how different zooxanthellae perform as partners. Other microbial associates of reef corals are much less well known, but studies indicate that individual coral colonies host diverse assemblages of bacteria, some of which seem to have species-specific associations. This diversity of microbial associates has important evolutionary and ecological implications. Most mutualisms evolve as balanced reciprocations that allow partners to detect cheaters, particularly when partners are potentially diverse and can be transmitted horizontally. Thus, environmental stresses that incapacitate the ability of partners to reciprocate can destabilize associations by eliciting rejection by their hosts. Coral bleaching (the loss of zooxanthellae) and coral diseases, both increasing over the last several decades, may be examples of stress-related mutualistic instability.},

For closely monitored groups like corals and marine mammals, reports of the frequency of epidemics and the number of new diseases have increased recently. A dramatic global increase in the severity of coral bleaching in 1997-98 is coincident with high El Ni{\~n}o temperatures. Such climate-mediated, physiological stresses may compromise host resistance and increase frequency of opportunistic diseases. Where documented, new diseases typically have emerged through host or range shifts of known pathogens. Both climate and human activities may have also accelerated global transport of species, bringing together pathogens and previously unexposed host populations.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium are among the most abundant and important group of eukaryotic microbes found in coral reef ecosystems. Recent analyses conducted on various host cnidarians indicated that Symbiodinium assemblages in the Caribbean Sea are genetically and ecologically diverse. In order to further characterize this diversity and identify processes important to its origins, samples from six orders of Cnidaria comprising 45 genera were collected from reef habitats around Barbados (eastern Caribbean) and from the Mesoamerican barrier reef off the coast of Belize (western Caribbean). Fingerprinting of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 identified 62 genetically different Symbiodinium. Additional analyses of clade B Symbiodinium using microsatellite flanker sequences unequivocally characterized divergent lineages, or "species," within what was previously thought to be a single entity (B1 or B184). In contrast to the Indo-Pacific where host-generalist symbionts dominate many coral communities, partner specificity in the Caribbean is relatively high and is influenced little by the host's apparent mode of symbiont acquisition. Habitat depth (ambient light) and geographic isolation appeared to influence the bathymetric zonation and regional distribution for most of the Symbiodinium spp. characterized. Approximately 80% of Symbiodinium types were endemic to either the eastern or western Caribbean and 40-50% were distributed to compatible hosts living in shallow, high-irradiance, or deep, low-irradiance environments. These ecologic, geographic, and phylogenetic patterns indicate that most of the present Symbiodinium diversity probably originated from adaptive radiations driven by ecological specialization in separate Caribbean regions during the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods.},

We asked whether the frequency of warm temperature anomalies is positively related to the frequency of coral disease across 1,500 km of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. We used a new high-resolution satellite dataset of ocean temperature and 6 y of coral disease and coral cover data from annual surveys of 48 reefs to answer this question. We found a highly significant relationship between the frequencies of warm temperature anomalies and of white syndrome, an emergent disease, or potentially, a group of diseases, of Pacific reef-building corals. The effect of temperature was highly dependent on coral cover because white syndrome outbreaks followed warm years, but only on high (>50%) cover reefs, suggesting an important role of host density as a threshold for outbreaks. Our results indicate that the frequency of temperature anomalies, which is predicted to increase in most tropical oceans, can increase the susceptibility of corals to disease, leading to outbreaks where corals are abundant.},

Lesser and Farrell
Coral Reefs 23(3): 367-377

Summary: Investigated synergy between solar radiation and thermally induced stress and subsequent bleaching on M. faceplate.

Question: Do solar radiation and temperature stress work synergistically to cause bleaching?

Methods:
Coral colonies kept in flow through saltwater tanks
Chl fluorescence (FRR)
MAA quantification
DNA damage

Results:
PSII fluorescence is markedly depressed with high radiation and temps
D1 protein lower in high light (under constant temp)
pigments and MAAs are depressed after exposure to high light and temp
Host DNA damage is worse under high light, correlated with expression of the cell cycle gene p 53 (a cellular gatekeeper that modulates the fate of damaged cells between DNA repair processes and apoptotic pathways.
"we conclude that thermal stress during exposure to high irradiances of solar radiation, or irradiances higher than the current photoacclimatization state, causes damage to both photochemistry and carbon fixation at the same time in zooxanthellae, while DNA damage, apoptosis, or necrosis are occurring in the host tissues of symbiotic cnidarians."
"Exposure to high irradiances of solar radiation leads to a lower bleaching threshold temperature and an overall shorter time to actually ``bleach'' compared to corals exposed to lower solar irradiances."
"The results described above point towards the complexity of the stress response in corals and that several cellular mechanisms can be responsible for the observed stress response known as bleaching."
Problems:

Impressions: 
Random: "10 days is sufficient time for the photosynthetic apparatus to reorganize and acclimatize to a new irradiance regime"},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Fishery management has historically been an inexact and reactionary discipline, often taking action only after a critical stock suffers overfishing or collapse. The invertebrate ornamental fishery in the State of Florida, with increasing catches over a more diverse array of species, is poised for collapse. Current management is static and the lack of an adaptive strategy will not allow for adequate responses associated with managing this multi-species fishery. The last decade has seen aquarium hobbyists shift their display preference from fish-only tanks to miniature reef ecosystems that include many invertebrate species, creating increased demand without proper oversight. The once small ornamental fishery has become an invertebrate-dominated major industry supplying five continents.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Here, we analyzed the Florida Marine Life Fishery (FLML) landing data from 1994 to 2007 for all invertebrate species. The data were organized to reflect both ecosystem purpose (in the wild) and ecosystem services (commodities) for each reported species to address the following question: Are ornamental invertebrates being exploited for their fundamental ecosystem services and economic value at the expense of reef resilience? We found that 9 million individuals were collected in 2007, 6 million of which were grazers.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:The number of grazers now exceeds, by two-fold, the number of specimens collected for curio and ornamental purposes altogether, representing a major categorical shift. In general, landings have increased 10-fold since 1994, though the number of licenses has been dramatically reduced. Thus, despite current management strategies, the FLML Fishery appears to be crawling to collapse.},

abstract = {Coral reefs in the Mexican Pacific and notably those of the continental coastline of Colima state are still poorly studied. Fortunately, recent efforts have been carried out by researchers from different Mexican institutions to fill up these information gaps. The aim of this study was to determine the ecological structure of the rich and undisturbed coral building communities of Carrizales by using the point transect interception method (25m-long). For this, three survey expeditions were conducted between June and October 2005 and September 2006; and for comparison purposes, the reef was subdivided according to its position in the bay, and depth (0 to 5 m, and 6 to 10 m). Thirteen coral species were observed in the area, with Pocillopora verrucosa as the most abundant, contributing up to 32.8% of total cover, followed by Porites panamensis and Pocillopora capitata with 11% and 7%, respectively. Other species, Pocillopora damicornis, Pavona gigantea, Pocillopora eydouxi and Pocillopora inflata accounted for 1.5% to 2% of coral cover whereas the remaining five species had cover of less than 1%. Seven of the observed species represented new records for Colima state coastline: Pocillopora eydouxi, P inflata, P meandrina, Pavona duerdeni, P varians, Psammocora stellata and P contigua. This last species is a relevant record, because it has never been observed before in the Eastern Pacific. Although there was no significant difference (ANOVA, p = 0.478) neither in the abundance between the sides of the bay, nor between the depths considered, and the shallow zone observed the higher coral cover. Live coral cover was up to 61%, one of the highest ever reported for the Mexican Pacific, including the Gulf of California. The observed values of diversity (H' = 0.44 +/- 0.02), uniformity (J' = 0.76 +/- 0.02), and taxonomic distinctness index (delta* = 45.87 +/- 3.16), showed that currently this is the most important coral reef of Colima coastline. Currently, this region does not show any disturbance effects, but the increasing economic development of Manzanillo, as one of the main commercial ports of Mexico, its proximity to the reef, and the burgeoning number of tourists, may have some ecosystem impacts, for which management and conservation plans for Colima coastline are highly recommended.},

The massively parallel 454-pyrosequencing generates vast amounts of ribosomal sequence data and has the potential to uncover more organisms, even rare species. However, the relatively short sequence lengths of ∼500 bp are suboptimal for taxonomic annotation and phylogenetic analyses. In this study, we assessed the potential of 18S ribosomal clone libraries to complement corresponding 454-pyrosequencing data with near full-length sequence information. This involved a comparison of protist community compositions in five polar samples suggested by 18S rDNA clone libraries, with the corresponding community compositions suggested by 454-pyrosequencing. The study was conducted with four Arctic water samples, focusing on the eukaryotic picoplankton (0.4--3 µm), and with one sample collected in the Southern Ocean, examining the entire size spectrum (> 0.4 µm). For all individual samples,...},

Many of these diseases, however, have been described solely on the basis of field characteristics, and in some instances there is disagreement as to whether an observed coral condition is actually a disease. A disease pathogen has been identified for only three coral diseases, and for only two of these has the pathogen been shown (in the laboratory) to be the disease agent. In one case, the same disease name has been used for several widely varying coral syndromes, whereas in another multiple disease names have been applied to symptoms that may be caused by a single disease. Despite the current confusion, rapid progress is being made.},

Confronting large-scale crises requires a major scaling-up of management efforts based on an improved understanding of the ecological processes that underlie reef resilience. Managing for improved resilience, incorporating the role of human activity in shaping ecosystems, provides a basis for coping with uncertainty, future changes and ecological surprises. Here we review the ecological roles of critical functional groups (for both corals and reef fishes) that are fundamental to understanding resilience and avoiding phase shifts from coral dominance to less desirable, degraded ecosystems. We identify striking biogeographic differences in the species richness and composition of functional groups, which highlight the vulnerability of Caribbean reef ecosystems. These findings have profound implications for restoration of degraded reefs, management of fisheries, and the focus on marine protected areas and biodiversity hotspots as priorities for conservation.},

Much of what has been discovered in the past 4 years is presented in this special issue. Among the significant findings, the role that various Vibrio species play in coral disease and health, the composition of the 'normal microbiota' of corals, and the possible role of viruses in the disease process are important additions to our knowledge. New information concerning disease resistance and vectors, variation in pathogen composition for both fungal diseases of gorgonians and black band disease across oceans, environmental effects on disease susceptibility and resistance, and temporal and spatial disease variations among different coral species is presented in a number of papers. While the Caribbean may still be the 'disease hot spot' for coral reefs, it is now clear that diseases of coral reef organisms have become a global threat to coral reefs and a major cause of reef deterioration.},

Fitt and Warner 1995
Biol Bull 189: 298-307

Summary: Mesocosm experiment with 4 species of coral (<i>Montastrea annularis, M. cavernosa, Agaricia agaricites, A. lamarcki</i>) under 4 temperature treatments (26, 30, 32, and 34 deg C). Also looked at the response to UV-A and UV-B light

Question: How do different light levels affect coral susceptibility to temperature-induced bleaching?

Methods: Mesocosm, Temperature treatments, measured photosynthetic rates and potential (fluorescence ratio and P:R)

Results: Both light quantity and quality can be important environmental factors in bleaching
"Zooxanthellae kept in dim light take longer, and often require higher temperatures, to achieve the same level of bleaching as seen in brighter light"
"Much more likely sources of synergistic light energy for bleaching are longer wavelength UV-A (wavelengths not screened out by MAAs) and blue light, both important in photosynthesis and therefore not screened out by the coral host"
"In this early study, the organisms that died at the lowest temperatures tested (M. annular is, A. lamarcki, and the hydrocoral Millepora sp) are the same species that are the first to react during natural bleaching events, lending support to the notion that the differential bleaching of zooxanthellate cnidarians exposed to moderately high temperatures in nature reflects the tolerances of their particular zooxanthellae."

Warner, Chilcoat, McFarland, Fitt 2002
Marine Biology 141:31-38

Summary: First study to document the long-term shifts in seasonal photosynthetic capacity of symbiotic dinoflagellates by chlorophyll pluorometry

Question:
Are there patterns of seasonal fluctuation in the photosynthetic capacity of PSII in symbiotic dinoflagellates in reef-building corals?
Are there intra- and interspecific difference in photosynthesis between corals at different depths.

Methods:
Used chl fluorescence as a proxy for photosynthetic capacity of PSII

Results:
Significant seasonal fluctuations in the quantum yield Fv/Fm found in all species at all depths
Highest photosynthetic capacity in mid-winter and early spring, and lowest in mid to late summer.
Shallower corals had greater fluctuations in Fv/Fm, whereas deeper corals had consistently higher values of Fv/Fm
"The results of this study, along with the seasonal components of other studies, show that coral bleaching is best viewed as the end point in a physiological continuum rather than an isolated sudden stress event."

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96(14) 8007-8012

Summary: Corals (M faveolata and M franks) sampled over a depth gradient (1-17m) for density and with PAM 

Question: How does bleaching change densities of Symbio, and how does it affect photosynthesis?

Methods: Cell counts and PAM and D1 protein content on natural bleaching corals, also exposed corals to thermal stress in the laboratory, also exposed cultured symbiotic dinoflagellates with high and low levels of thermal tolerance to elevated temperature

Results: Lower densities of symbio during bleaching year of 1997, Severe damage to photosystem II in remaining symbionts
"Perturbation of PSII protein turnover rates during photo inhibition at elevated temperatures underlies the physiological collapse of symbionts in corals susceptible to heat-induced bleaching"
Naturally bleached corals: showed a decline in photosynthetic efficiency at increasing depths
Cultured dinoflagellates: Symbio exhibit host-specific differences (species-specific differences?) to heat stress
"This study provides direct evidence of irreversible damage to photosystem II in heat-stressed symbiotic dinoflagellates within corals during a natural bleaching event." "Moreover, dinoflagellates of bleaching-resistant corals have significantly greater capacity for maintenance of PSII at elevated temperatures than do those of thermal-sensitive corals"
"One interpretation of our results showing greater stress to deeper M. franks is that this coral contains a monomorphic assemblage of symbionts belonging to clade "C", purported by Rowan et al to be the most sensitive taxon under "slight increases of temperature and irradiance.""
"Therefore, there is no clear correlation between the phylotype (clade) of these algae and their physiological tolerance to elevated temperature."
High PAR is not a prerequisite for photosystem damage per se. 
"One explanation for this pattern is that the symbionts of shallow-water corals could be genotypically distinct in regard to PSII maintenance at elevated temperatures. In addition, shallow-water corals normally harbor greater densi- ties of symbiotic dinoflagellates than their deeper counterparts (personal observation), presumably enabling some protection by self-shading and requiring a longer period of exposure to show signs of stress to PSII."
"our results strongly suggest that thermal stress does have a primary effect on enhanced PSII reaction-center destabilization outpacing its repair, and these are pivotal physiological alterations in sym- biotic dinoflagellates that underlie coral bleaching."

Problems:

Impressions: If a meta-analysis was to be done, could look at effects of temperature (other stressors, but I don't think there are any) on photosynthetic efficiency (seems pretty standard) other ideas are cell counts, other measures?},

abstract = {Coral bleaching has been defined as a general phenomenon, whereby reef corals turn visibly pale because of the loss of their symbiotic dinoflagellates and/or algal pigments during periods of exposure to elevated seawater temperatures. During the summer of 1997, seawater temperatures in the Florida Keys remained at or above 30 degrees C for more than 6 weeks, and extensive coral bleaching was observed. Bleached colonies of the dominant Caribbean reef-building species, Montastrea faveolata and Montastrea franksi, were sampled over a depth gradient from 1 to 17 m during this period of elevated temperature and contained lower densities of symbiotic dinoflagellates in deeper corals than seen in previous nonbleaching years. Fluorescence analysis by pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometry revealed severe damage to photosystem II (PSII) in remaining symbionts within the corals, with greater damage indicated at deeper depths. Dinoflagellates with the greatest loss in PSII activity also showed a significant decline in the D1 reaction center protein of PSII, as measured by immunoblot analysis. Laboratory experiments on the temperature-sensitive species Montastrea annularis, as well as temperature-sensitive and temperature-tolerant cultured symbiotic dinoflagellates, confirmed the temperature-dependent loss of PSII activity and concomitant decrease in D1 reaction center protein seen in symbionts collected from corals naturally bleached on the reef. In addition, variation in PSII repair was detected, indicating that perturbation of PSII protein turnover rates during photoinhibition at elevated temperatures underlies the physiological collapse of symbionts in corals susceptible to heat-induced bleaching.},

Summary: Description of the diversity an community structure of symbiotic dinoflagellates are described from reef invertebrates (wide range of reef inverts)

Question: Does the community change between inshore/offshore environments, across latitudinal gradients, or across wide geographic ranges?

Methods:
Sampled a wide range of symbiotic invertebrates (75 genera, 154 species)
They did not try to quantify the complete diversity of symbionts for a particular host (this would require exhaustive sampling from every environment in which the host is found.
ITS2 region 
Lists Symbiont types by species sampled

Results:
Mention differences in changes between horizontal and vertical transmitters - "The mode of symbiont acquisition may play an important role in how symbiont composition may shift in west Pacific host communities in response to climate change."
** "There is no indication that recent episodes of mass bleaching have provoked changes in host-symbiont combinations from the central GBR" **
They conclude that since a majority of western pacific corals broadcast spawn eggs and sperm that do not contain symbionts, that "coral populations from this expansive region may be highly susceptible to shifts in symbiont type from generation to generation." Which is interesting, but is it necessarily true? I suppose that it perceivably could be easier to obtain different symbionts if the coral had to uptake them every generation rather than having them transferred from the parent. However, the amount that those communities can change is directly related to the selectivity and specificity in the uptake of symbionts. Just because a coral can uptake symbionts doesn't absolutely mean that it will uptake different ones. (Conversely it could{\ldots}.)
Another quote I'm not too sure about. "It cannot be determined if the increase iof clade D (specifically type D1) in proportion to clade C (possibly involving different types within this clade) among individual coral colonies was due to natural selection of thermally resistant combinations or whether symbiont population shifts occurred via proliferation of a minor population of Clade D within colonies as they recovered." What exactly does this mean? How are these two options different? Isn't the ability to proliferate after a disturbance (aka having increased fitness over the bleached types) related to natural selection?
**"This trend offers further support of an inverse relationship between host and symbiont diversity"** What? Their trend compares host and symbiont assemblages across GBR vs. Caribbean vs. Hawaii. I am not sure that this at all supports the idea of this inverse relationship. Primarily because you should probably also look at these trends across a host diversity gradient within region, because just looking at 3 regions can't really tell you the mechanism behind it.
" Regions with a high diversity of hosts involved in acquiring symbionts from the environment may favour the maintenance of highly prevalent generalist symbionts (Law 1985). Host rarity would present problems for passively dispersed symbionts and newly settled aposymbiotic larvae in finding each other within a diverse host community over effectively vast spatial scales." Very interesting, and something I'm interested in testing.
"Widely distributed symbiont types tend to be host- generalists and are, phylogenetically, ancestral to symbionts that are more specialized." Is this supported by their evidence? Then they also say " this example demonstrates the capacity for a symbiont to be specialized for 1 particular host in 1 region, but to display more generalized associations of greater prevalence at other locations."

Problems:
It seems a little wild to look at such a wide taxonomic array of species and then make conclusions of symbiont types. In some ways it makes perfect sense, but I wonder if they're losing any information by spreading their analysis thin

Impressions: 
This was boldly counter to all the current research at the time by saying that bleaching Does Not change host-symbiont interactions

Seems like the statement that "the rarity and probably host-specific nature of this type indicates that clade D also consists of geographically widespread host-generalists and more localized, host-specific and/or rare forms." seems like a pointless statement. Don't most clades have both widespread generalists and rare specialists? Is this actually limited to just clade D?

Pretty hollow curves of symbiont communities across a wide geographic range

I am not sure if I'm just extra rude today, or if this paper makes some wildly unsupported claims with absolutely no legitimate scientific backing.},

abstract = {Deep sequencing of PCR amplicon libraries facilitates the detection of low-abundance populations in environmental DNA surveys of complex microbial communities. At the same time, deep sequencing can lead to overestimates of microbial diversity through the generation of low-frequency, error-prone reads. Even with sequencing error rates below 0.005 per nucleotide position, the common method of generating operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by multiple sequence alignment and complete-linkage clustering significantly increases the number of predicted OTUs and inflates richness estimates. We show that a 2% single-linkage preclustering methodology followed by an average-linkage clustering based on pairwise alignments more accurately predicts expected OTUs in both single and pooled template preparations of known taxonomic composition. This new clustering method can reduce the OTU richness in environmental samples by as much as 30-60% but does not reduce the fraction of OTUs in long-tailed rank abundance curves that defines the rare biosphere.},

abstract = {Throughout the natural world, organisms have responded to predators, inadequate resources, or inclement conditions by forming ongoing mutually beneficial partnerships--or symbioses--with different species. Symbiosis is the foundation for major evolutionary events, such as the emergence of eukaryotes and plant eating among vertebrates, and is also a crucial factor in shaping many ecological communities. The Symbiotic Habit provides an accessible and authoritative introduction to symbiosis, describing how symbioses are established, function, and persist in evolutionary and ecological time. Angela Douglas explains the evolutionary origins and development of symbiosis, and illustrates the principles of symbiosis using a variety of examples of symbiotic relationships as well as nonsymbiotic ones, such as parasitic or fleeting mutualistic associations. Although the reciprocal exchange of benefit is the key feature of symbioses, the benefits are often costly to provide, causing conflict among the partners. Douglas shows how these conflicts can be managed by a single controlling organism that may selectively reward cooperative partners, control partner transmission, and employ recognition mechanisms that discriminate between beneficial and potentially harmful or ineffective partners. The Symbiotic Habit reveals the broad uniformity of symbiotic process across many different symbioses among organisms with diverse evolutionary histories, and demonstrates how symbioses can be used to manage ecosystems, enhance food production, and promote human health.},

abstract = {Holobionts are species-specific associations between macro- and microorganisms. On coral reefs, the benthic coverage of coral and algal holobionts varies due to natural and anthropogenic forcings. Different benthic macroorganisms are predicted to have specific microbiomes. In contrast, local environmental factors are predicted to select for specific metabolic pathways in microbes. To reconcile these two predictions, we hypothesized that adaptation of microbiomes to local conditions is facilitated by the horizontal transfer of genes responsible for specific metabolic capabilities. To test this hypothesis, microbial metagenomes were sequenced from 22 coral reefs at 11 Line Islands in the central Pacific that together span a wide range of biogeochemical and anthropogenic influences. Consistent with our hypothesis, the percent cover of major benthic functional groups significantly correlated with particular microbial taxa. Reefs with higher coral cover had a coral microbiome with higher abundances of Alphaproteobacteria (such as Rhodobacterales and Sphingomonadales), whereas microbiomes of algae-dominated reefs had higher abundances of Gammaproteobacteria (such as Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, and Vibrionales), Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. In contrast to taxa, geography was the strongest predictor of microbial community metabolism. Microbial communities on reefs with higher nutrient availability (e.g., equatorial upwelling zones) were enriched in genes involved in nutrient-related metabolisms (e.g., nitrate and nitrite ammonification, Ton/Tol transport, etc.). On reefs further from the equator, microbes had more genes encoding chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosystems I/II. These results support the hypothesis that core microbiomes are determined by holobiont macroorganisms, and that those core taxa adapt to local conditions by selecting for advantageous metabolic genes.},

abstract = {Changing land use and the spread of 'winning' native or exotic plants are expected to lead to biotic homogenization (BH), in which previously distinct plant communities become progressively more similar. In parallel, many ecosystems have recently seen increases in local species (alpha-) diversity, yet gamma-diversity has continued to decline at larger scales. Using national ecological surveillance data for Great Britain, we quantify relationships between change in alpha-diversity and between-habitat homogenizations at two levels of organization: species composition and plant functional traits. Across Britain both increases and decreases in alpha-diversity were observed in small random sampling plots (10-200m2) located within a national random sample of 1km square regions. As alpha-diversity declined (spatially in 1978 or temporally between 1978 and 1998), plant communities became functionally more similar, but species-compositional similarity declined. Thus, different communities converged on a narrower range of winning trait syndromes, but species identities remained historically contingent, differentiating a mosaic of residual species-poor habitat patches within each 1km square. The reverse trends in beta-diversity occurred where alpha-diversity increased. When impacted by the same type and intensity of environmental change, directions of change in alpha-diversity are likely to depend upon differences in starting productivity and disturbance. This is one reason why local diversity change and BH across habitats are not likely to be consistently coupled.},

Summary:
Compared photosynthetic rates of corals with Symbio clades C and D at different temperatures 

Question:
Does clade D perform better (photosynthetically) at higher temperatures than clade C?

Methods:
Lab experiment
Flowthrough seawater tanks at different temperatures
Symbiodinium identity determined by large ribosomal subunit RNA
PAM to measure Fv/Fm

Results:
Symbio D is a high-temperature specialist
"Differences observed here are regarded as intrinsic symbiont adaptations that apparently contribute significantly to whole-coral physiology."
"These observations, which may apply to other corals, indicate that symbiosis recombination may be one mechanism by which corals adapt, in part, to global warning."

Carpenter, et al (2008)
Science 321:560-563

Summary: Used ICUN redlist criteria to evaluate 845 coral species

Question: How threatened are coral reefs?

Methods:

Results:
Corals are very threatened, and "Our consensus view is that the loss of reef ecosystems would lead to large-scale loss of global biodiversity."
Caribbean has the largest proportion of corals in the high extinction risk categories
Coral triangle has the highest proportion of species in all categories of elevated extinction risk

Problems:

Although the empirical study of biotic homogenization is substantial and growing, the mechanisms underlying its dynamics remain poorly understood. We recently developed a theoretical model that predicts levels of biotic homogenization or differentiation (i.e., decreased community similarity) according to a series of distinct mechanisms that describe the outcomes of various interactions between native species, nonnative species, and the environment. Here, we test this model using empirical data for freshwater fish faunas in the United States at three spatial scales: the entire continent, zoogeographic provinces in California, and watersheds within these provinces. Our analysis reveals that, in general, mechanisms depicting widespread introductions of cosmopolitan species and eithe...},

abstract = {Modeling with Data fully explains how to execute computationally intensive analyses on very large data sets, showing readers how to determine the best methods for solving a variety of different problems, how to create and debug statistical models, and how to run an analysis and evaluate the results. Ben Klemens introduces a set of open and unlimited tools, and uses them to demonstrate data management, analysis, and simulation techniques essential for dealing with large data sets and computationally intensive procedures. He then demonstrates how to easily apply these tools to the many threads of statistical technique, including classical, Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and Monte Carlo methods. Klemens's accessible survey describes these models in a unified and nontraditional manner, providing alternative ways of looking at statistical concepts that often befuddle students. The book includes nearly one hundred sample programs of all kinds. Links to these programs will be available on this page at a later date. Modeling with Data will interest anyone looking for a comprehensive guide to these powerful statistical tools, including researchers and graduate students in the social sciences, biology, engineering, economics, and applied mathematics.},

abstract = {It is critical to assess the effectiveness of the tools used to protect endangered species. The main tools enabled under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) to promote species recovery are funding, recovery plan development and critical habitat designation. Earlier studies sometimes found that statistically significant effects of these tools could be detected, but they have not answered the question of whether the effects were large enough to be biologically meaningful. Here, we ask: how much does the recovery status of ESA-listed species improve with the application of these tools? We used species' staus reports to Congress from 1988 to 2006 to quantify two measures of recovery for 1179 species. We related these to the amount of federal funding, years with a recovery plan, years with critical habitat designation, the amount of peer-reviewed scientific information, and time listed. We found that change in recovery status of listed species was, at best, only very weakly related to any of these tools. Recovery was positively related to the number of years listed, years with a recovery plan, and funding, however, these tools combined explain <13% of the variation in recovery status among species. Earlier studies that reported significant effects of these tools did not focus on effect sizes; however, they are in fact similarly small. One must conclude either that these tools are not very effective in promoting species' recovery, or (as we suspect) that species recovery data are so poor that it is impossible to tell whether the tools are effective or not. It is critically important to assess the effectiveness of tools used to promote species recovery; it is therefore also critically important to obtain population status data that are adequate to that task.},

Coral Reefs 24:482-487

Summary: Explored patterns of zooxanthella distribution of three species across a latitudinal and cross-shelf gradient in the GBR after a bleaching event.

Question:

Methods:
Factors: Coral health status (bleaching)
Response: Symbiont type (ITS1)


Results:
"No correlations between symbiont types and either the level of bleaching of individual colonies or indicators of heat stress at individual sites. However there was a very high post-bleaching abundance of the heat tolerant symbiont type D in one coral population at the most heat stressed site."
Can't tell the difference between shuffling or differential mortality

Problems:
They don't actually know if the corals had bleached during the bleaching event.

Combining chemical, genomic and molecular approaches, we show that coral juveniles produce DMSP in the absence of algal symbionts. DMSP levels increased up to 54% over time in newly settled coral juveniles lacking algal endosymbionts, and further increases, up to 76%, were recorded when juveniles were subjected to thermal stress. We uncovered coral orthologues of two algal genes recently identified in DMSP biosynthesis, strongly indicating that corals possess the enzymatic machinery necessary for DMSP production. Our results overturn the paradigm that photosynthetic organisms are the sole biological source of DMSP, and highlight the double jeopardy represented by worldwide declining coral cover, as the potential to alleviate thermal stress through coral-produced DMSP declines correspondingly.},

Summary: Characterizing microbial communities on Kingman, Kiritimati Palmyra and Tabuaeran atolls

Question:How do microbial communities change between inhabited vs. uninhabited atolls in the Pacific?

Methods:
Metagenomics
Epifluorescent Microscopy - direct counts
Culturing - Vibrio
Water chemistry - DOC, TDIN, P, Nitrogen isotopes
Respiration experiments
Coral health, Percent benthic cover

Results:
10X more microbial cells and virus-like particles in the water column at Kiritimati than Kingman
Kiritimati dominated by heterotrophs more than kinsman
Palmyra and Tabuaeran - intermediate densities of microbes and viruses {\&}amp; higher % autotrophs than Kingman or Kirtimati
The Kiritmati microbial comment is detrimental to corals

**"A complete survey of Kiritimati will be able to determine if the rest of the atoll (which includes areas that are not fished or adjacent to villages) has lost its coral cover and subsequent fish populations. If the coral communities are still in place, this would argue against a large scale bleaching event as the triggering event. One caveat is that local hydrology could protect one part of the island, while another area bleaches. Again, cores should help differentiate between these possibilities. Surveys of additional coral reefs would help establish whether there are correlations between coral condition and changes in the microbial communities."**
"Ecosystem-based management of coral reefs has traditionally focused on animals and plants. Our findings highlight the need to explicitly include microbial processes and their influence on coral reef ecosystem function. Such a framework is also needed to elucidate factors that sustain coral health."

Problems:

Impressions: I think this is really informative (and can provide information for my Kiritimati Symbio paper) but also it paints the entire atoll of Kiritimati as a degraded environment, which is certainly not true. (Think about the differences between the lagoon/sites 26/30 and sites 15/19/20{\ldots} HUGE difference). Using this paper may be tricky - I need to convince people that the areas that aren't right next to the populated areas are actually much more healthy. It is the biggest atoll after all.},

Stretching from the Caribbean to the western Pacific, the coral reefs of the USA span extensive geographic and biotic diversity, occur in a wide variety of geomorphological settings, and provide a representative cross-section of Holocene reef-building. This book will therefore be of broad general interest. For the first time, complete scholarly reviews are given for the geology, geomorphology and the biology of reefs encompassing a vast area stretching from the Mariana Islands in the west, Samoa in the south, Hawaii in the north and the Virgin Islands in the east. This book is not a status report, but will provide up-to-date information about stressors and the biotic responses of the reefs, as well as the geological explanations why these reefs exist in the first place. It will be an invaluable baseline-reference for all those who are engaged in research or management of these coral reefs or to those who simply enjoy being well-informed about one of the most iconic ecosystems of the USA.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Most reviews concerning the impact of climate change on coral reefs discuss independent effects of warming or ocean acidification. However, the interactions between these, and between these and direct local stressors are less well addressed. This review underlines that coral bleaching, acidification, and diseases are expected to interact synergistically, and will negatively influence survival, growth, reproduction, larval development, settlement, and post-settlement development of corals. Interactions with local stress factors such as pollution, sedimentation, and overfishing are further expected to compound effects of climate change. Reduced coral cover and species composition following coral bleaching events affect coral reef fish community structure, with variable outcomes depending on their habitat dependence and trophic specialisation. Ocean acidification itself impacts fish mainly indirectly through disruption of predation- and habitat-associated behavior changes. Zooxanthellate octocorals on reefs are often overlooked but are substantial occupiers of space; these also are highly susceptible to bleaching but because they tend to be more heterotrophic, climate change impacts mainly manifest in terms of changes in species composition and population structure. Non-calcifying macroalgae are expected to respond positively to ocean acidification and promote microbe-induced coral mortality via the release of dissolved compounds, thus intensifying phase-shifts from coral to macroalgal domination. Adaptation of corals to these consequences of CO2 rise through increased tolerance of corals and successful mutualistic associations between corals and zooxanthellae is likely to be insufficient to match the rate and frequency of the projected changes. Impacts are interactive and magnified, and because there is a limited capacity for corals to adapt to climate change, global targets of carbon emission reductions are insufficient for coral reefs, so lower targets should be pursued. Alleviation of most local stress factors such as nutrient discharges, sedimentation, and overfishing is also imperative if sufficient overall resilience of reefs to climate change is to be achieved.},

Although these estimates of risk can be accurate, the lists have inevitably become linked to several decision-making processes. There are four ways in which such lists are commonly used: to set priorities for resource allocation for species recovery; to inform reserve system design; to constrain development and exploitation; and to report on the state of the environment. The lists were not designed for any one of these purposes, and consequently perform some of them poorly. We discuss why, if and how they should be used to achieve these purposes.},

Habitat loss is the most prevalent threat (84%), followed by overexploitation (32%), native species interactions (31%), natural causes (27%), pollution (26%), and introduced species (22%). Agriculture (46%) and urbanization (44%) are the most common human activities causing habitat loss and pollution. For extant species, the number of threats per species increases with the level of endangerment. The prevalence of threat types varies among major habitats, with overexploitation being particularly important, and introduced species particularly unimportant, for marine species. Introduced species are a much less important threat in Canada than in the United States, but the causes of endangerment are broadly similar for Canadian and globally endangered species.},

abstract = {The threats of wide-scale coral bleaching and reef demise associated with anthropogenic climate change are widely known. Here, the additional role of poor water quality in lowering the thermal tolerance (i.e. bleaching 'resistance') of symbiotic reef corals is considered. In particular, a quantitative linkage is established between terrestrially-sourced dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) loading and the upper thermal bleaching thresholds of inshore reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Significantly, this biophysical linkage provides concrete evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of corals reefs to global climate change. Indeed, for inshore reef areas with a high runoff exposure risk, it is shown that the potential benefit of this 'local' management imperative is equivalent to approximately 2.0-2.5 degrees C in relation to the upper thermal bleaching limit; though in this case, a potentially cost-prohibitive reduction in end-of-river DIN of >50-80% would be required. An integrated socio-economic modelling framework is outlined that will assist future efforts to understand (optimise) the alternate tradeoffs that the water quality/coral bleaching linkage presents.},

In the past 10 years, numerous studies have reported that -- in many contexts -- generalist species are ``replacing'' specialist species. We review recent research on the concept of the ecological niche and species specialization, and conclude that (1) the observed worldwide decline in specialist species is predicted by niche theory, (2) specialist declines cause ``functional homogenization'' of biodiversity, and (3) such homogenization may be used to measure the impact of disturbance on communities. Homogenization at the community level could alter ecosystem functioning and productivity, as well as result in the deterioration of ecosystem goods and services. We propose community-level specialization as an indicator of the impact of global changes (habitat and climate disturbances) on biodiversity.},

We compiled records, extending back thousands of years, of the status and trends of seven major guilds of carnivores, herbivores, and architectural species from 14 regions. Large animals declined before small animals and architectural species, and Atlantic reefs declined before reefs in the Red Sea and Australia, but the trajectories of decline were markedly similar worldwide. All reefs were substantially degraded long before outbreaks of coral disease and bleaching. Regardless of these new threats, reefs will not survive without immediate protection from human exploitation over large spatial scales.},

We analyzed bird communities in 657 plots monitored by the French Breeding Bird Survey from 2001 to 2005, accounting for the probability of species detection and spatial autocorrelation. We used an independent land-cover program to assess urbanization intensity in each FBBS plot, from 1992 to 2002. We found that urbanization induced community homogenization and that populations of specialist species became increasingly unstable with increasing urbanization of the landscape. Our results emphasize that urbanization has a substantial impact on the spatial component of communities and highlight the destabilizing effect of urbanization on communities over time. These results illustrate that urbanization may be a strong driving force in functional community composition and that measuring community homogenization is a powerful tool in the assessment of the effects of landscape changes and thus aides sustainable urban planning.},

Question: How do assemblages of holobiont communitites (Symbiodinium + host) differ in high latitudes vs. tropical reefs?

Methods:
PCR-DGGE ITS2

Results:
"Besides 'host-generalist' Symbiodinium types C1 and C3 approximately 72% of the Symbiodinium identified were novel C types, and donation of symbionts in relations to environmental parameters such as depth and turbidity was evident in certain host species."
"Although host specificity was maintained in certain species, others shared symbionts and this potential reduction of fidelity at high-latitude locations may be there result of locally challenging and highly variable environmental conditions."
**"Turbidity was the primary predictive environmental parameter for all host species and although the parameters of depth, salinity and temperature had varying effects, they were correlated with each other indicating that the affects of each parameter on symbiont distributions could not be distinguished."
"Whilst ITS-level 'host specificity' has previously bee reported to be greatest in unstable and isolated environments, the relaxation of 'host specificity' at the high-latitude isolated sites in the present study suggests the opposite."

Summary: "Using a newly developed real-time PCR assay, this paper demonstrates that previous studies have underestimated the presence of background symbionts because of the low sensitivity of the techniques used. The assay used here targets the multi-copy rDNA ITS1 region and is able to detect Symbiodinium clades C and D with {\&}gt;100-fold higher sensitivity compared to conventional techniques."

Question: What proportion of corals actually harbour background clades?

Methods:
ITS1

Results:
Background clades detected in 78% of 82 colonies
1,500,000 zoox cells/cm2, background level of approx 100-10,000 cells/cm2 of clade D
The potential for symbiont shuffling is higher than previously thought

Summary: Investigated specificity of symbiont uptake in larvae of one coral species

Question: Do different symbiont types (homologous vs. heterologous) have differential success rates in forming symbioses with host corals?

Methods: "Infected" Fungia scutaria larvae with symbionts from adult Fungia and from other coral species.

Results: Homologous (from adult Fungia) symbionts associated more successfully with the coral than heterologous (from other coral species) - "Despite their occurrence in the same clade (clade C), there were clear differences in their abilities to establish a symbiosis in F. scutaria larvae. "  " These within-clade differences in specificity contribute to overwhelming biochemical, physiological, and molecular evidence of the taxonomic diversity of zooxanthellae resident within cnidarians."
There is a specificity process which occurs sometime during the early stages of infection between partners, and which results in the establishment of a specific symbiosis.

Problems: I think one problem was that they didn't emphasize the fact that these other symbiodinium <i>did</i> in fact form associations with Fungia (even though they weren't as successful as the homologous types)

Monitored Symbiodinum physiologicalparameters and profiled the coral host transcriptional responses in acclimated, thermally stressed, and recovered fragments of Montastrea faveolata using a custom cDNA gene expression microarray.

Results:
Host transcriptomic states grouped according to Symbiodinium genotype rather than thermal stress. aka "we provide strong evidence that the symbiont genotype had a substantial influence on host gene expression, and thus diminished our ability to detect more genes differentially expressed during thermal stress and recovery."

Genotyping tools for Symbiodinium spp. have added a new level of complexity to studies concerning cnidarian growth, nutrient acquisition, and stress. For example, the response of the coral holobiont to thermal stress is connected to the host-Symbiodinium genotypic combination, as different partnerships can have different bleaching susceptibilities. In this study, we monitored Symbiodinium physiological parameters and profiled the coral host transcriptional responses in acclimated, thermally stressed, and recovered fragments of the coral Montastraea faveolata using a custom cDNA gene expression microarray. Interestingly, gene expression was more similar among samples with the same Symbiodinium content rather than the same experimental condition. In order to discount for host-genotypic effects, we sampled fragments from a single colony of M. faveolata containing different symbiont types, and found that the host transcriptomic states grouped according to Symbiodinium genotype rather than thermal stress. As the first study that links coral host transcriptomic patterns to the clade content of their Symbiodinium community, our results provide a critical step to elucidating the molecular basis of the apparent variability seen among different coral-Symbiodinium partnerships.},

Summary: Survey of molecular diversity of symbiodinium in Bermuda, the Mediterranean and NE Atlantic

Question: Are high latitude (marginal) symbioses different than Caribbean (core) symbioses?

Methods:
RFLP and ITS1-2 to define taxonomy
Compared between Bermuda, Mediterranean and the NE Atlantic

Results:
Found new undescribed group (Phylotype A) in sea anemones in the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean
Found less diversity of symbionts at higher latitudes

Problems:
"If, as is widely accepted in the coral literature, ecosystem resilience is related to diversity, the species-poor communities of symbiotic Cnidaria at marginal sites of Bermuda and NE Atlantic and Mediterranean are predicted to be vulnerable to environmental change."
I am not sure that there is enough evidence to agree with the logic behind this statement.

Summary: Looked at a gradient of host-symbiont association across a depth gradient for Montastraea annular is

Question: Do zooxanthellae communities exhibit zonation with depth (0-14 meters)?

Methods: ssRNA, RFLP

Results:
"Analysis of two dominant Caribbean corals showed that each associates with three taxa of zooxanthellae that exhibit donation with depth - the primary environmental gradient for light-dependent marine organisms."
"Some colonies apparently host two types of symbionts in proportions that can vary across the colony."
"Polymorphic symbioses may underlie the conspicuous and enigmatic variability characteristic of responses to environmental stress (e.g., coral "bleaching") and contribute importantly to the phenomenon of photo adaptation."

Problems:

Impressions: First time they found more than one Symbio type in a single coral species. This paper was seminal to our understanding of coral-symbiont interactions!! First time Symbiodinium diversity was really proposed as a mechanism for adaptive change.

"The ability of corals to exist in symbiosis with several species of zooxanthellae would create a variety of forms that greatly transcends the number of one host-one symbiont combinations, challenging the conventional focus on the coral animal species as the fundamental unit of ecological diversity."

<b>"Our findings also establish empirical precedents for suggestions that infraspecific and intracolony variability in the stress-mediated disruption of coral-algal symbioses [coral "bleaching"] is a manifestation of zooxanthella diversity and that bleaching could promote adaptive changes in coral-zooxanthella associations."</b>},

Summary: Response to Goulet's 2006 review paper

Question:

Methods:

Results:
"1) Almost two-thirds of the coral species investigated have been severely under sampled (N{\&}lt;5)
2)more than three-quarters of the scleractinian (stony) coral species sampled more adequately (N{\&}gt;10) most multiple Symbiodinium clades, or multiple types within a clade
3) scleractinian corals are more flexible than octocorals
4) Almost all scleractinian coral families can host more than one symbiont clade."

Also,
"1) Scleractinain corals commonly host multiple symbiont types within a Symbiodinium clade
2) Symbiont communities in scleractinian corals are dynamic
3) 'Cryptic' symbiont taxa found at low abundance within colonies are unlikely to be molecular artifacts."

"Octocorals show relatively weak increases in symbiont diversity with increased sampling effort, while diversity recorded in scleractinian corals increases relatively rapidly."

"{\ldots}the evidence for the presence of background symbionts is overwhelming, and{\ldots}most field surveys published to date are extremely likely to have underestimated within-colony Symbiodinium diversity at all taxonomic levels."

"Scleractinian corals are considerably more flexible than their octocoral counterparts, which may be related to their greater dependence on autotrophy."

abstract = {The relationship between reef corals and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates is fundamental to the existence of coral reefs. To evaluate the fidelity of coral-Symbiodinium mutualisms, corals maintained in aquaria for years were analyzed by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Comparing Symbiodinium populations of captive aquarium colonies with known associations in nature is a practical way of examining partner flexibility. The finding of "normal" symbiont populations in corals existing under highly variable conditions supports the premise that most coral colonies possess stable associations. High sensitivity real-time PCR (rtPCR) was used to evaluate background populations of the putatively stress-tolerant Symbiodinium D in reef corals of the Caribbean. Analyses of samples collected during periods of environmental stability indicate the ability of Symbiodinium D to associate with a wider diversity of host taxa than previously recognized. To gain a broader perspective with regard to the ecology of Symbiodinium D1a, rtPCR and DGGE were used to evaluate the symbiont populations of reef corals from Barbados before and after the 2005 mass coral bleaching. Background populations were observed in 56% of the host genera prior to observations of bleaching. These findings indicate that 'stress', not 'bleaching', caused the displacement of 'natural' symbiont population and the opportunistic proliferation of D1a in many host taxa. Of the 12 host taxa monitored before and after the bleaching event, there was a 40% increase in colonies hosting Symbiodinium D1a. Together, these studies elucidate the mechanism responsible for recent observations reporting the emergence of Symbiodinium D following thermal disturbances. These observations are now most easily explained as the disproportionate growth of existing in hospite symbiont populations, rather than novel symbiont acquisition subsequent to bleaching. To evaluate the comparative "fitness" of corals able to host multiple symbiont types, rates of calcification were measured in P. verrucosa hosting either Symbiodinium C1b-c or D1 at elevated temperature. Rates of calcification decreased significantly for both host-symbiont combinations, but differences attributable to symbiont composition were not detected. This research improves our knowledge of the symbiosis biology and ecology of reef corals and contributes information necessary to most accurately predict the response of these ecosystems to global climate changes.},

abstract = {Symbiodinium, a unicellular dinoflagellate, is crucial to the survival of symbiotic invertebrate hosts like corals. In some cases, the type of Symbiodinium a host associates with can affect host thermal tolerance and physiological processes. Some species of hosts may be able to switch their symbiont type to acclimate to changing environmental conditions. New, diverse types of Symbiodinium might be available for symbiotic hosts to uptake from free-living Symbiodinium populations. Thus the diversity of free-living Symbiodinium is of particular interest in the face of increasingly frequent and widespread coral bleaching events, primarily caused by increases in sea temperature. This thesis compared the genetic diversity of free-living Symbiodinium in the water column and sediments of coral reefs of Hawai'i, the Florida Keys, and Okinawa Japan. 41 Symbiodinium cp23S-HVR sequence variants were identified and grouped into clades A, B, C, D, F, and G; 24 of these sequence variants were novel. Results indicate that free-living Symbiodinium communities are diverse and have complex overlaps between habitats and regions and with symbiotic communities. In addition, tank experiments were conducted to test whether asymbiotic larvae of the coral Acropora monticulosa preferentially acquired free-living Symbiodinium from the water column or sediments to establish their symbiosis. Results from this experiment clearly showed free-living Symbiodinium were acquired by asymbiotic larvae earlier, in greater proportion and with greater in hospite Symbiodinium densities in sediment-containing treatments when compared to seawater-only treatments. These two studies revealed that free-living Symbiodinium communities are diverse with intricate patterns of distribution and that sediments may represent an important source of free-living Symbiodinium for establishing symbiosis with invertebrate hosts. The data obtained in this thesis can be used in future studies to help determine interactions of free-living Symbiodinium community with their symbiotic counterpart and with symbiotic hosts to help predict the response of Symbiodinium and the symbiotic hosts to climate change.},

abstract = {"Symbioses and Stress centers on the question of how organisms in tight symbiotic associations cope with various types of abiotic and biotic stress. In its original sense, symbioses cover all kinds of interactions among unrelated organisms, whereas in a narrower concept, the term is often referred to as mutualism. Evolutionary biology recognizes symbiosis as an integrative process, and most fundamental evolutionary innovations arose from cooperative symbioses. Mutualisms contribute to stress tolerance, ecosystem stability, and evolutionary radiation of cooperating organisms. Modern eukaryotic cells are the result of the endosymbiotic union of prokaryotic ancestors as well as diverse exosymbiotic associations. This cooperative aggregation appears more successful than its independent parts. This new book presents functional and evolutionary aspects of mutually beneficial symbioses among unrelated organisms."--P. [4] of cover.},

Summary: Host-symbiont gentling in Acropora from the GBR to looks for patterns of specificity

Question: How are host and symbiont types related in nature?

Methods: Genotyped 28 Acroporid species (host and symbio)
"We used sequences of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (rDNA ITS1 region to construct the symbiont phylogeny" "Unlike the rDNA genes, which have been strongly conserved through evolutionary time due to functional constraints, the ITS regions are free to undergo much faster substitution rates and provide an amount of sequence variation generally suitable for comparisons at the inter-and intra-species level in algae

Results: 
Three subclades in C were identified
composition of Symbio pool varied among locales
Light-related patterns of zooxanthella distribution in one host species
Did not find evidence that Acropora had coevolved with their symbionts
"The occurrence of a particular Symbiodinium taxon in A. Acropora species appears to be determined by a number of factors, including the local availability of zooxanthellae, ambient light levels, genetic identity of the host and possibly competition between physiologically different zooxanthella taxa"

In this study, we determined phylogenetic relationships between Symbiodinium isolates from a wide range of Acropora species and plotted the algal genotypes onto a molecular phylogeny of 28 Acropora species, using the same samples for the host and symbiont genotyping. In addition, we performed a preliminary survey of zooxanthella distribution in Acropora species from the central Great Barrier Reef. Three of the four known major zooxanthellae clades were represented in the 168 samples examined, and within the major clade C, three distinct subclades were identified. No evidence was found for coevolution, but several clear patterns of specificity were identified. Moreover, composition of the zooxanthella pool varied among locales and in one host species we found light-related patterns of zooxanthella distribution.},

abstract = {The symbiosis between reef-building corals and photosynthetic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) is an integral part of the coral reef ecosystem, as corals are dependent on Symbiodinium for the majority of their energy needs. However, this partnership is increasingly at risk due to changing climatic conditions. It is thought that functional diversity within Symbiodinium may allow some corals to rapidly adapt to different environments by changing the type of Symbiodinium with which they partner; however, very little is known about the molecular basis of the functional differences among symbiont groups. One group of Symbiodinium that is hypothesized to be important for the future of reefs is clade D, which, in general, seems to provide the coral holobiont (i.e., coral host and associated symbiont community) with elevated thermal tolerance. Using high-throughput sequencing data from field-collected corals we assembled, de novo, draft transcriptomes for Symbiodinium clades C and D. We then explore the functional basis of thermal tolerance in clade D by comparing rates of coding sequence evolution among the four clades of Symbiodinium most commonly found in reef-building corals (A-D).
We are able to highlight a number of genes and functional categories as candidates for involvement in the increased thermal tolerance of clade D. These include a fatty acid desaturase, molecular chaperones and proteins involved in photosynthesis and the thylakoid membrane. We also demonstrate that clades C and D co-occur within most of the sampled colonies of Acropora hyacinthus, suggesting widespread potential for this coral species to acclimatize to changing thermal conditions via 'shuffling' the proportions of these two clades from within their current symbiont communities.
Transcriptome-wide analysis confirms that the four main Symbiodinium clades found within corals exhibit extensive evolutionary divergence (18.5-27.3% avg. pairwise nucleotide difference). Despite these evolutionary distinctions, many corals appear to host multiple clades simultaneously, which may allow for rapid acclimatization to changing environmental conditions. This study provides a first step toward understanding the molecular basis of functional differences between Symbiodinium clades by highlighting a number of genes with signatures consistent with positive selection along the thermally tolerant clade D lineage.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) is expected to negatively affect coral reefs, however little is known about how OA will change the coral-algal symbiosis on which reefs ultimately depend. This study investigated whether there would be differences in coral Symbiodinium types in response to OA, potentially improving coral performance. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of ribosomal DNA to investigate the dominant types of Symbiodinium associating with six species of scleractinian coral that were exposed to elevated partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in situ from settlement and throughout their lives. The study was conducted at three naturally occurring volcanic CO2 seeps (pCO2 ∼500 to 900 ppm, pHTotal 7.8 - 7.9) and adjacent control areas (pCO2 ∼390 ppm, pHTotal ∼8.0 - 8.05) in Papua New Guinea. The Symbiodinium associated with corals living in an extreme seep site (pCO2 >1000 ppm) were also examined. Ten clade C types and three clade D types dominated the 443 coral samples. Symbiodinium types strongly contrasted between coral species, however, no differences were observed due to CO2 exposure. Within five species, 85 - 95% of samples exhibited the same Symbiodinium type across all sites, with remaining rare types having no patterns attributable to CO2 exposure. The sixth species of coral displayed site specific differences in Symbiodinium types, unrelated to CO2 exposure. Symbiodinium types from the coral inhabiting the extreme CO2 seep site were found commonly throughout the moderate seeps and control areas. Our finding that symbiotic associations did not change in response to CO2 exposure suggest that, within the six coral hosts, none of the investigated 13 clade C and D Symbiodinium types had a selective advantage at high pCO2. Acclimatisation through changing symbiotic association therefore does not seem to be an option for Indo-Pacific corals to deal with future OA.},

Most coral reefs exist in oligotrophic waters, and their survival strategy in such nutrient-depleted waters remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that two strains of Symbiodinium spp. cultured from the environment and acquired from the tissues of the coral Alveopora japonica had the ability to feed heterotrophically. Symbiodinium spp. fed on heterotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.), and small microalgae in both nutrient-replete and nutrient-depleted conditions. Cultured free-living Symbiodinium spp. displayed no autotrophic growth under nitrogen-depleted conditions, but grew when provided with prey. Our results indicate that Symbiodinium spp.'s mixotrophic activity greatly increases their chance of survival and their population growth under nitrogen-depleted conditions, which tend to prevail in coral habitats. In particular, free-living Symbiodinium cells acquired considerable nitrogen from algal prey, comparable to or greater than the direct uptake of ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, or urea. In addition, free-living Symbiodinium spp. can be a sink for planktonic cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.) and remove substantial portions of Synechococcus populations from coral reef waters. Our discovery of Symbiodinium's feeding alters our conventional views of the survival strategies of photosynthetic Symbiodinium and corals.},

The aims of this study were to examine Symbiodinium diversity and distribution associated with scleractinian corals in five atolls of the Chagos Archipelago, spread over 10,000 km(2). Symbiodinium clade diversity in 262 samples of seven common coral species, Acropora muricata, Isopora palifera, Pocillopora damicornis, P. verrucosa, P. eydouxi, Seriatopora hystrix, and Stylophora pistillata were determined using PCR-SSCP of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), PCR-DDGE of ITS2, and phylogenetic analyses. The results indicated that Symbiodinium in clade C were the dominant symbiont group in the seven coral species. Our analysis revealed types of Symbiodinium clade C specific to coral species. Types C1 and C3 (with C3z and C3i variants) were dominant in Acroporidae and C1 and C1c were the dominant types in Pocilloporidae. We also found 2 novel ITS2 types in S. hystrix and 1 novel ITS2 type of Symbiodinium in A. muricata. Some colonies of A. muricata and I. palifera were also associated with Symbiodinium A1. These results suggest that corals in the Chagos Archipelago host different assemblages of Symbiodinium types then their conspecifics from other locations in the Indian Ocean; and that future research will show whether these patterns in Symbiodinium genotypes may be due to local adaptation to specific conditions in the Chagos.},

abstract = {Coral throughout the world are under threat. To save coral via cryopreservation methods, the Symbiodinium algae that live within many coral cells must also be considered. Coral juvenile must often take up these important cells from their surrounding water and when adult coral bleach, they lose their endosymbiotic algae and will die if they are not regained. The focus of this paper was to understand some of the cryo-physiology of the endosymbiotic algae, Symbiodinium, living within three species of Hawaiian coral, Fungia scutaria, Porites compressa and Pocillopora damicornis in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Although cryopreservation of algae is common, the successful cryopreservation of these important coral endosymbionts is not common, and these species are often maintained in live serial cultures within stock centers worldwide. Freshly-extracted Symbiodinium were exposed to cryobiologically appropriate physiological stresses and their viability assessed with a Pulse Amplitude Fluorometer. Stresses included sensitivity to chilling temperatures, osmotic stress, and toxic effects of various concentrations and types of cryoprotectants (i.e., dimethyl sulfoxide, propylene glycol, glycerol and methanol). To determine the water and cryoprotectant permeabilities of Symbiodinium, uptake of radio-labeled glycerol and heavy water (D"2O) were measured. The three different Symbiodinium subtypes studied demonstrated remarkable similarities in their morphology, sensitivity to cryoprotectants and permeability characteristics; however, they differed greatly in their sensitivity to hypo- and hyposmotic challenges and sensitivity to chilling, suggesting that standard slow freezing cryopreservation may not work well for all Symbiodinium. An appendix describes our H"2O:D"2O water exchange experiments and compares the diffusionally determined permeability with the two parameter model osmotic permeability.},

abstract = {Endosymbiotic algae of the genus Symbiodinium have been divided into nine clades (A-I) following genetic classification; some clades are known to have physiological properties that enable the coral hosts to adapt to different environmental conditions. To understand the relationships of coral-alga symbioses, we focused on Symbiodinium diversity in zooxanthellate corals living under the severe environmental conditions of the temperate region (30$\,^{\circ}$-35$\,^{\circ}$N) of Japan. We investigated Symbiodinium clades in 346 colonies belonging to 58 coral species from six locations. We then selected three coral species-Acropora hyacinthus, Acropora japonica, and Cyphastrea chalcidicum-to investigate whether Symbiodinium clades changed during winter or summer over the course of year (May 2009-Apr 2010) in Tanabe Bay, Japan. Three Symbiodinium clades (C, D, and F) were detected in corals in the temperate region. Notably, 56 coral species contained Symbiodinium clade C. Oulastrea crispata predominantly contained clade D, but traces of clade C were also detected in all samples. The temperate-specific species Alveopora japonica contained clades C and F simultaneously. Seasonal change of symbiont clades did not occur in the three coral species during the investigation period where SSTs range on 12.5-29.2$\,^{\circ}$C. However, we found Acropora (2 spp.) and Cyphastrea (1 sp.) contained different subcladal types of clade C. These results reveal that most coral species harbored Symbiodinium clade C stably throughout the year, suggesting that Symbiodinium clade C shows low-temperature tolerance, and that two hypothetical possibilities; genetic differences of subcladal types generating physiological differences or wide physiological flexibility in the clade C.},

abstract = {The dinoflagellate photosymbiont Symbiodinium plays a fundamental role in defining the physiological tolerances of coral holobionts, but little is known about the dynamics of these endosymbiotic populations on coral reefs. Sparse data indicate that Symbiodinium populations show limited spatial connectivity; however, no studies have investigated temporal dynamics for in hospite Symbiodinium populations following significant mortality and recruitment events in coral populations. We investigated the combined influences of spatial isolation and disturbance on the population dynamics of the generalist Symbiodinium type C2 (ITS1 rDNA) hosted by the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora in the central Great Barrier Reef. Using eight microsatellite markers, we genotyped Symbiodinium in a total of 401 coral colonies, which were sampled from seven sites across a 12-year period including during flood plume-induced coral bleaching. Genetic differentiation of Symbiodinium was greatest within sites, explaining 70-86% of the total genetic variation. An additional 9-27% of variation was explained by significant differentiation of populations among sites separated by 0.4-13 km, which is consistent with low levels of dispersal via water movement and historical disturbance regimes. Sampling year accounted for 6-7% of total genetic variation and was related to significant coral mortality following severe bleaching in 1998 and a cyclone in 2006. Only 3% of the total genetic variation was related to coral bleaching status, reflecting generally small (8%) reductions in allelic diversity within bleached corals. This reduction probably reflected a loss of genotypes in hospite during bleaching, although no site-wide changes in genetic diversity were observed. Combined, our results indicate the importance of disturbance regimes acting together with limited oceanographic transport to determine the genetic composition of Symbiodinium types within reefs.

In comparison to a control temperature treatment (28 degrees C), we documented dramatic changes in bacterial associates on juvenile corals harbouring ITS 1 type D Symbiodinium when placed in a high (32 degrees C) temperature treatment. In particular, there was a marked increase in the number of retrieved Vibrio affiliated sequences, which coincided with a 44% decline in the photochemical efficiency of the D-juveniles. Interestingly, these Vibrio sequences affiliated most closely with the coral pathogen, Vibrio coralliilyticus, which has been implicated in some coral disease outbreaks. In contrast, A. tenuis hosting ITS 1 type C1 Symbiodinium did not exhibit major bacterial shifts in the elevated temperature treatment, indicating a more stable bacterial community during thermal stress; concomitantly a decline (10%) in photochemical efficiency was minimal for this group. D juveniles that had been exposed to moderately elevated sea temperatures (30 degrees C) in the field before being placed in the control temperature treatment displayed a decrease in the number of Vibrio affiliated sequences and bacterial profiles shifted to become more similar to profiles of corals harbouring type C1 Symbiodinium. In combination, these results demonstrate that thermal stress can result in shifts in coral-associated bacterial communities, which may lead to deteriorating coral health. The lower resilience of A. tenuis to thermal stress when harbouring Symbiodinium D highlights the importance of inter-kingdom interactions among the coral host, dinoflagellate endosymbiont and bacterial associates for coral health and resilience.},

In this study, we investigate how temperature and light affect the uptake of the algal symbionts, ITS1 types C1 and D, by juveniles of the broadcast-spawning corals Acropora tenuis and A. millepora. Elevated temperatures had a strong negative effect on Symbiodinium uptake in both coral species, with corals at 31 $\,^{\circ}$C showing as little as 8% uptake compared to 87% at 28 $\,^{\circ}$C. Juveniles in high light treatments (390 µmol photons m(-2) s(-1)) had lower cell counts across all temperatures, emphasizing the importance of the light environment during the initial uptake phase. The proportions of the two Symbiodinium types taken up, as quantified by a real time PCR assay using clade C- and D-specific primers, were also influenced by temperature, although variation in uptake dynamics between the two coral species indicates a host effect. At 28 $\,^{\circ}$C, A. tenuis juveniles were dominated by C1 Symbiodinium, and while the number of D Symbiodinium cells increased at 31 $\,^{\circ}$C, they never exceeded the number of C1 cells. In contrast, juveniles of A. millepora had approximately equal numbers of C1 and D cells at 28 $\,^{\circ}$C, but were dominated by D at 30 $\,^{\circ}$C and 31 $\,^{\circ}$C. This study highlights the significant role that environmental factors play in the establishment of coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis and provides insights into how potentially competing Symbiodinium types take up residence in coral juveniles.},

Summary: Explanted juveniles of two Acropora species to observe the initial uptake of Symbiodinium types

Question: What Symbiodinium types are taken up first by juvenile corals?

Methods:
Explants of A. tennis and A. millepora
ITS1
SSCP
2 light treatments (horizontal and vertical)
Sampled random coral colonies around the juveniles

Results:
coral juveniles were rapidly dominated by type D Symbiodinium (even thought this isn't found in adult colonies - including parental colonies, and it was not excessively dominant in the environment)
"We conclude that during early ontogeny in these corals, there are few barriers to the uptake of Symbiodinium types which differ from those found in parental colonies, resulting in dominance by a highly infectious and potentially opportunistic symbiont."
No difference in the type of Symbiodinium taken up by coral juveniles exposed to different irradiance levels (4x difference between horizontal and vertical tiles, but no difference in Symbio clade).
"The evidence suggesting that there are few barriers to the uptake of non homologous symbionts by corals during early ontogeny is compelling"

However, factors shaping the initial establishment of coral-algal symbioses, including parental effects, local environmental conditions and local availability of symbionts, are not well understood. This study monitored the uptake and maintenance of Symbiodinium in juveniles of two common corals, Acropora tenuis and Acropora millepora, that were reciprocally explanted between sites where adult colonies host different types of Symbiodinium. We found that coral juveniles were rapidly dominated by type D Symbiodinium, even though this type is not found in adult colonies (including the parental colonies) in four out of the five study populations. Furthermore, type D Symbiodinium was found in less than one-third of a wide range of coral species (n > 50) sampled at the two main study sites, suggesting that its dominance in the acroporid juveniles is not because it is the most abundant local endosymbiotic type. Moreover, dominance by type D was observed irrespective of the light intensity to which juveniles were exposed in a field study. In summary, despite its relatively low abundance in coral assemblages at the study sites and irrespective of the surrounding light environment, type D Symbiodinium is the main symbiont type initially acquired by juveniles of A. millepora and A. tenuis. We conclude that during early ontogeny in these corals, there are few barriers to the uptake of Symbiodinium types which differ from those found in parental colonies, resulting in dominance by a highly infectious and potentially opportunistic symbiont.},

Summary: USed flow cytometry to show what happens to Symbio when they are expelled from coral

Question: Can corals be reinfected at high temperatures by Symbiodinium that were expelled?

Methods:
Lab experiment
Temperature stress
Stained expelled cells to see how/if they died (Flow cytomtetry)
Response: Number of expelled cells, Necrotic or apoptotic

Results:
"Symbiodinium from octocorals may represent "pools" of genetically resistant symbionts available for reinfection of other reef organisms."
"The characterization of more apoptotic and necrotic cells than viable cells is critical, as this indicates that the loss of Symbiodinium cells cannot be beneficial to other bleached corals for symbiotic reassociation."
Bleaching occurs through apoptosis or necrosis
Octocorals have a higher symbiont turnover rate than scleractinian corals
1. "Symbiodinium lost from host coral tissue cannot be categorized simply as live or dead cells, but as viable, apoptotic, or necrotic cells."
2. "The % of viable cells lost due to bleaching may be much less than that previously described by other authors using Tb viability counts"
3. "The fraction of viable Symbiodinium cells lost from tow of the three octocorals tested in this study increased at higher temperatures, indicating that their symbionts may have different temperature tolerances and, thus, turnover rates."

Problems:
Comparing the differences between symbiodinium types when they don't actually do any genetic analyses to tell what symbiodinium types are actually there.

Despite the majority of lost Symbiodinium cells being viable at 28 ^oC, the predominance of apoptotic and necrotic symbiont cells at higher temperatures indicates that the proportion of live cells decreases with increasing temperature. This implies that reinfection of corals at high temperatures by Symbiodinium lost from scleractinian corals may be less frequent than previously described, since many of the symbiont cells exhibit nonreversible symptoms of approaching cell death. The fraction of viable Symbiodinium cells lost from S. ehrenbergi, Xenia sp., and Sinularia at 32 ^oC was greater than that at 28 ^oC. At 34 ^oC, the fraction of viable cells lost from S. ehrenbergi and Xenia sp. fell but not from Sinularia sp., which suggests that their symbionts have higher temperature tolerances. Thus, Symbiodinium from octocorals may represent ''pools'' of genetically resistant symbionts available for reinfection of other reef organisms. This has been proposed previously for Symbiodinium in some scleractinian corals, but this is the first evidence for such, particularly for an octocoral. Many of the viable cells, determined using Trypan blue staining techniques, are in fact actually undergoing apoptosis or necrosis, when examined using Annexin V-fluor and propidium iodide staining profiles. The characterization of more apoptotic and necrotic cells than viable cells is critical, as this indicates that the loss of Symbiodinium cells cannot be beneficial to other bleached corals for symbiotic reassociation.},

Summary:

Question:
Do the same taxa and patterns of association (Symbiodinium A and B found in higher irradiance habitats than Symbiodinium C) occur on a ninshore reef?
Does M. franks at the limits of its depth range host only Symbiodinium C, as it does at intermediate depths?
Is RFLP actually useful in classifying Symbiodinium?

Methods:

Results:
Found new Symbiodinium taxa and different patterns of distribution of Symbio types as before
"We propose that the Symbiodinium E we observed represents a taxon of zooxanthella that occurs in certain habitats not because it performs best in those habitats, but because it tolerates them. whereas Symbiodinium A, B, and C do not. According to this idea, Symbiodinium E is rare or absent from other habitats not because it performs poorly in them, but because Symbiodinium A, B, and C are better adapted to those habitats and somehow exclude it."
"These experimental results suggest that, in addition to tolerating stress, Symbiodinum E may also be good at colonizing corals whose zooxanthellae communities have been severely disrupted by stress."

Problems:

Impressions: 
"Thus corals identified as members of the same species may not in fact be equivalent at the whole organism (holobiont) level, and the taxonomic identities of zooxanthellae maybe as ecologically important as those of their hosts."
"Descriptive studies of unmanipulated corals are, however, indispensable for framing realistic hypothesis in the first place."
*I think this was the first study to realize that A, B, C, D didn't cut it. They actually didn't believe it, but I think what they were seeing were what we know as "types" today.},

abstract = {Corals of the Montastraea annularis complex host several different dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. Here we address two questions arising from our previous studies of these associations on an offshore reef. First, do the same taxa and patterns of association (Symbiodinium A and B found in higher irradiance habitats than Symbiodinium C) occur on an inshore reef? Second, does M. franksi at the limits of its depth range host only Symbiodinium C, as it does at intermediate depths? In both surveys, a new Symbiodinium taxon and different patterns of distribution (assayed by analyses of small ribosomal subunit RNA genes [srDNA]) were observed. Inshore, a taxon we name Symbiodinium E predominated in higher irradiance habitats in M. franksi and its two sibling species; the only other zooxanthella observed was Symbiodinium C. Offshore, M. franksi mainly hosted Symbiodinium C, but hosted Symbiodinium A, B, C, and E in shallow water and Symbiodinium E and C in very deep water. Symbiodinium E may be stress-tolerant. Observed srDNA heterogeneity within samples of Symbiodinium B, C, and E is interpreted as variation across copies within this multigene family. Experimental bleaching of Symbiodinium C supported this interpretation. Thus sequences from natural samples should be interpreted cautiously.},

Summary: Documenting natural succession of Symbiodinium types within juvenile corals by monitoring Symbio communities in 2 Acropora species for 3.5 years

Question: How do symbiont flexibility and successional changes occur in coral juveniles from different reef populations with different Symbiodinium types?
Are temporal changes in dominant Symbiodinium populations linked to ontogenetic changes associated with the onset of reproductive maturity of the coral host.

Methods: 
ITS1
SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism)

Results:
A tennis - establishment of the adult homologous association at ~3.5 yr
A millepora - symbio did not change during the 3.5 year study. 
"Juvenile corals may survive for extended periods of time with non homologous Symbiodinium types and that closely related species of Acropora differ in the timing of the onset of specificity for algal symbionts."
No link between onset of sexual maturity and symbiont composition, but maybe a link to the changes in micro-environmental conditions associated with 3-D growth of juveniles

abstract = {Juveniles of a number of corals with horizontal transmission of dinoflagellate endosymbionts naturally acquire and maintain Symbiodinium types that differ from those found in adult populations. However, the duration of this early period of symbiont flexibility and successional changes leading to dominance by the characteristic adult (homologous) type are unknown. To document natural succession of Symbiodinium types within juvenile corals, we monitored Symbiodinium communities in juveniles of Acropora tenuis and Acropora millepora for 3.5 years. Juveniles originating from one of three reef populations, characterized by differing adult coral-Symbiodinium associations, were raised in a common environment. In four out of five cases, juveniles became dominated initially by a nonhomologous adult type. Changes in Symbiodinium communities associated with A. tenuis juveniles led to the establishment of the adult homologous association at approximately 3.5 years of age. These changes were not linked to the onset of reproductive maturity, but may be linked to micro-environmental changes associated with vertical growth of juvenile corals. We hypothesize that fine-tuning of specificity mechanisms takes place during ontogeny in A. tenuis, leading to the eventual establishment of the adult homologous association. However, Symbiodinium communities in A. millepora juveniles did not change significantly over the 3.5 years, potentially reflecting (i) lack of specificity, (ii) more than a 3.5-year delay in the onset of specificity, or (iii) lack of availability of the adult Symbiodinium type. This study demonstrates that juvenile corals may survive for extended periods of time with nonhomologous Symbiodinium types and that closely related species of Acropora differ in the timing of the onset of specificity for algal symbionts.},

Summary: Measuring carbon acquisition for 2 Symbiodinium A types

Question: Are there adaptive differences in inorganic carbon acquisition within Symbiodinium?

Methods:
Symbiodinium types A13 and A20
Responses: Rubisco, 14C uptake (carbon fixation), inorganic carbon species preference, external carbonic anhydrase activity

Results:
"These results show that adaptive differences in inorganic carbon acquisition have evolved within the Symbiodinium genus, which thus carries fundamental implications as to how this functionally key genus will respond to ocean acidification, but could also represent a key trait factor that influences their productivity when in hospice of their coral hosts."

Problems:
They say these are two symbiotic clade A, but A20 has never been found in symbiosis with coral

abstract = {Growing concerns over ocean acidification have highlighted the need to critically understand inorganic carbon acquisition and utilization in marine microalgae. Here, we contrast these characteristics for the first time between two genetically distinct dinoflagellate species of the genus Symbiodinium (phylotypes A13 and A20) that live in symbiosis with reef-forming corals. Both phylotypes were grown in continuous cultures under identical environmental conditions. Rubisco was measured using quantitative Western blots, and radioisotopic (14) C uptake was used to characterize light- and total carbon dioxide (TCO2 )-dependent carbon fixation, as well as inorganic carbon species preference and external carbonic anhydrase activity. A13 and A20 exhibited similar rates of carbon fixation despite cellular concentrations of Rubisco being approximately four-fold greater in A13. The uptake of CO2 over HCO3 - was found to support the majority of carbon fixation in both phylotypes. However, A20 was also able to indirectly utilize HCO3 - by first converting it to CO2 via external carbonic anhydrase. These results show that adaptive differences in inorganic carbon acquisition have evolved within the Symbiodinium genus, which thus carries fundamental implications as to how this functionally key genus will respond to ocean acidification, but could also represent a key trait factor that influences their productivity when in hospite of their coral hosts.},

This includes the production of nitric oxide (NO), which is involved in numerous microbial symbioses. Much of NO's cytotoxicity has been attributed to its conversion, in the presence of superoxide (O2(-)), to highly reactive peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)). However, ONOO(-) generation has yet to be observed in either a lower invertebrate or an intracellular mutualism. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy with the fluorescent ONOO(-) indicator aminophenyl fluorescein (APF), we observed strong evidence that ONOO(-) is generated in symbiotic Aiptasia pulchella under conditions known to induce thermal bleaching. However, a role for ONOO(-) in bleaching remains unclear as treatment with a peroxynitrite scavenger had no significant effect on thermal bleaching. Therefore, while ONOO(-) may have a potential for cytotoxicity, in vivo levels of the compound may be insufficient to affect bleaching.},

abstract = {The Aiptasia-Symbiodinium symbiosis is a promising model for experimental studies of cnidarian-dinoflagellate associations, yet relatively little is known regarding the genetic diversity of either symbiotic partner. To address this, we collected Aiptasia from 16 localities throughout the world and examined the genetic diversity of both anemones and their endosymbionts. Based on newly developed SCAR markers, Aiptasia consisted of two genetically distinct populations: one Aiptasia lineage from Florida and a second network of Aiptasia genotypes found at other localities. These populations did not conform to the distributions of described Aiptasia species, suggesting that taxonomic re-evaluation is needed in the light of molecular genetics. Associations with Symbiodinium further demonstrated the distinctions among Aiptasia populations. According to 18S RFLP, ITS2-DGGE and microsatellite flanker region sequencing, Florida anemones engaged in diverse symbioses predominantly with members of Symbiodinium Clades A and B, but also C, whereas anemones from elsewhere harboured only S. minutum within Clade B. Symbiodinium minutum apparently does not form a stable symbiosis with other hosts, which implies a highly specific symbiosis. Fine-scale differences among S. minutum populations were quantified using six microsatellite loci. Populations of S. minutum had low genotypic diversity and high clonality (R = 0.14). Furthermore, minimal population structure was observed among regions and ocean basins, due to allele and genotype sharing. The lack of genetic structure and low genotypic diversity suggest recent vectoring of Aiptasia and S. minutum across localities. This first ever molecular-genetic study of a globally distributed cnidarian and its Symbiodinium assemblages reveals host-symbiont specificity and widely distributed populations in an important model system.},

In this work we show that it is possible for host cells to initiate apoptosis that can contribute to death of the Symbiodinium cell. First we found that colchicine, which results in apoptosis in other animals, causes cell death in the model anemone Aiptasia sp. but not in cultured Symbiodinium CCMP-830 cells or in cells freshly isolated from host Aiptasia (at least within the time frame of our study). In contrast, when symbiotic Aiptasia were incubated in colchicine, cell death in the resident Symbiodinium cells was observed, suggesting a host effect on symbiont mortality. Using live-cell confocal imaging of macerated symbiotic host cell isolates, we identified a pattern where the initiation of host cell death was followed by mortality of the resident Symbiodinium cells. This same pattern was observed in symbiotic host cells that were subjected to temperature stress. This research suggests that mortality of symbionts during temperature-induced bleaching can be initiated in part by host cell apoptosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) within coral reef invertebrates are critical to the survival of the holobiont. The genetic variability of Symbiodinium may contribute to the tolerance of the symbiotic association to elevated sea surface temperatures (SST). To assess the importance of factors such as the local environment, host identity and biogeography in driving Symbiodinium distributions on reef-wide scales, data from studies on reef invertebrate-Symbiodinium associations from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) were compiled.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:The resulting database consisted of 3717 entries from 26 studies. It was used to explore ecological patterns such as host-specificity and environmental drivers structuring community complexity using a multi-scalar approach. The data was analyzed in several ways: (i) frequently sampled host species were analyzed independently to investigate the influence of the environment on symbiont distributions, thereby excluding the influence of host specificity, (ii) host species distributions across sites were added as an environmental variable to determine the contribution of host identity on symbiont distribution, and (iii) data were pooled based on clade (broad genetic groups dividing the genus Symbiodinium) to investigate factors driving Symbiodinium distributions using lower taxonomic resolution. The results indicated that host species identity plays a dominant role in determining the distribution of Symbiodinium and environmental variables shape distributions on a host species-specific level. SST derived variables (especially SSTstdev) most often contributed to the selection of the best model. Clade level comparisons decreased the power of the predictive model indicating that it fails to incorporate the main drivers behind Symbiodinium distributions.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Including the influence of different host species on Symbiodinium distributional patterns improves our understanding of the drivers behind the complexity of Symbiodinium-invertebrate symbioses. This will increase our ability to generate realistic models estimating the risk reefs are exposed to and their resilience in response to a changing climate.},

abstract = {Coral reefs provide habitat for an array of marine invertebrates that host symbiotic microbiomes. Photosynthetic symbionts including Symbiodinium dinoflagellates and diatoms potentially influence the diversity of their host-associated microbiomes by releasing carbon-containing photosynthates and other organic compounds that fuel microbial metabolism. Here we used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon pyrosequencing to characterise the microbiomes of 11 common Great Barrier Reef marine invertebrate species that host photosynthetic symbionts and five taxa in which they are absent. The presence of photosynthetic symbionts influenced the composition but not the species richness, evenness and phylogenetic diversity of invertebrate-associated microbiomes. Invertebrates without photosynthetic symbionts were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, whereas those hosting photosynthetic symbionts were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria. Interestingly, many microbial species from photosymbiont-bearing invertebrates, including Oceanospirillales spp., Alteromonas spp., Pseudomonas spp., Halomonas spp., are implicated in the metabolism of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). DMSP is produced in high concentrations by photosynthetic dinoflagellates and is involved in climate regulation by facilitating cloud formation. Microbiomes correlated with host taxa and replicate individuals from most sampled species grouped in distance-based redundancy analysis of retrieved 16S rRNA gene sequences. This study highlights the complex nature of invertebrate holobionts and confirms the importance of photosynthetic symbionts in structuring marine invertebrate bacterial communities.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:Metabolic interactions with endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium spp. are fundamental to reef-building corals (Scleractinia) thriving in nutrient-poor tropical seas. Yet, detailed understanding at the single-cell level of nutrient assimilation, translocation, and utilization within this fundamental symbiosis is lacking. Using pulse-chase (15)N labeling and quantitative ion microprobe isotopic imaging (NanoSIMS; nanoscale secondary-ion mass spectrometry), we visualized these dynamic processes in tissues of the symbiotic coral Pocillopora damicornis at the subcellular level. Assimilation of ammonium, nitrate, and aspartic acid resulted in rapid incorporation of nitrogen into uric acid crystals (after ~45 min), forming temporary N storage sites within the dinoflagellate endosymbionts. Subsequent intracellular remobilization of this metabolite was accompanied by translocation of nitrogenous compounds to the coral host, starting at ~6 h. Within the coral tissue, nitrogen is utilized in specific cellular compartments in all four epithelia, including mucus chambers, Golgi bodies, and vesicles in calicoblastic cells. Our study shows how nitrogen-limited symbiotic corals take advantage of sudden changes in nitrogen availability; this opens new perspectives for functional studies of nutrient storage and remobilization in microbial symbioses in changing reef environments.

IMPORTANCE:The methodology applied, combining transmission electron microscopy with nanoscale secondary-ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging of coral tissue labeled with stable isotope tracers, allows quantification and submicrometric localization of metabolic fluxes in an intact symbiosis. This study opens the way for investigations of physiological adaptations of symbiotic systems to nutrient availability and for increasing knowledge of global nitrogen and carbon biogeochemical cycling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Understanding the mechanisms by which natural populations cope with environmental stress is paramount to predict their persistence in the face of escalating anthropogenic impacts. Reef-building corals are increasingly exposed to local and global stressors that alter nutritional status causing reduced fitness and mortality, however, these responses can vary considerably across species and populations.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We compare the expression of 22 coral host genes in individuals from an inshore and an offshore reef location using quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) over the course of 26 days following translocation into a shaded, filtered seawater environment. Declines in lipid content and PSII activity of the algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium ITS-1 type C2) over the course of the experiment indicated that heterotrophic uptake and photosynthesis were limited, creating nutritional deprivation conditions. Regulation of coral host genes involved in metabolism, CO2 transport and oxidative stress could be detected already after five days, whereas PSII activity took twice as long to respond. Opposing expression trajectories of Tgl, which releases fatty acids from the triacylglycerol storage, and Dgat1, which catalyses the formation of triglycerides, indicate that the decline in lipid content can be attributed, at least in part, by mobilisation of triacylglycerol stores. Corals from the inshore location had initially higher lipid content and showed consistently elevated expression levels of two genes involved in metabolism (aldehyde dehydrogenase) and calcification (carbonic anhydrase).

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Coral host gene expression adjusts rapidly upon change in nutritional conditions, and therefore can serve as an early signature of imminent coral stress. Consistent gene expression differences between populations indicate that corals acclimatize and/or adapt to local environments. Our results set the stage for analysis of these processes in natural coral populations, to better understand the responses of coral communities to global climate change and to develop more efficient management strategies.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the degree to which corals undergo physiological acclimatization or genetic adaptation in response to changes in their thermal environment is crucial to the success of coral reef conservation strategies. The potential of corals to acclimatize to temperatures exceeding historical thermal regimes was investigated by reciprocal transplantation of Acropora millepora colonies between the warm central and cool southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) for a duration of 14 months. Colony fragments retained at native sites remained healthy, whereas transplanted fragments, although healthy over initial months when temperatures remained within native thermal regimes, subsequently bleached and suffered mortality during seasonal temperature extremes. Corals hosting Symbiodinium D transplanted to the southern GBR bleached in winter and the majority suffered whole (40%; n=20 colonies) or partial (50%) mortality at temperatures 1.1 degrees C below their 15-year native minimum. In contrast, corals hosting Symbiodinium C2 transplanted to the central GBR bleached in summer and suffered whole (50%; n=10 colonies) or partial (42%) mortality at temperatures 2.5 degrees C above their 15-year native maximum. During summer bleaching, the dominant Symbiodinium type changed from C2 to D within corals transplanted to the central GBR. Corals transplanted to the cooler, southern GBR grew 74-80% slower than corals at their native site, and only 50% of surviving colonies reproduced, at least partially because of cold water bleaching of transplants. Despite the absence of any visual signs of stress, corals transplanted to the warmer, central GBR grew 52-59% more slowly than corals at their native site before the summer bleaching (i.e., from autumn to spring). Allocation of energy to initial acclimatization or reproduction may explain this pattern, as the majority (65%) of transplants reproduced one month earlier than portions of the same colonies retained at the southern native site. All parameters investigated (bleaching, mortality, Symbiodinium type fidelity, reproductive timing) demonstrated strong interactions between genotype and environment, indicating that the acclimatization potential of A. millepora populations may be limited by adaptation of the holobiont to native thermal regimes.},

abstract = {Biological clocks are self-sustained endogenous timers that enable organisms (from cyanobacteria to humans) to anticipate daily environmental rhythms, and adjust their physiology and behaviour accordingly. Symbiotic corals play a central role in the creation of biologically rich ecosystems based on mutualistic symbioses between the invertebrate coral and dinoflagellate protists from the genus Symbiodinium. In this study, we experimentally establish that Symbiodinium photosynthesis, both as a free-living unicellular algae and as part of the symbiotic association with the coral Stylophora pistillata, is 'wired' to the circadian clock mechanism with a 'free-run' cycle close to 24 h. Associated photosynthetic pigments also showed rhythmicity under light/dark conditions and under constant light conditions, while the expression of the oxygen-evolving enhancer 1 gene (within photosystem II) coincided with photosynthetically evolved oxygen in Symbiodinium cultures. Thus, circadian regulation of the Symbiodinium photosynthesis is, however, complicated as being linked to the coral/host that have probably profound physiochemical influence on the intracellular environment. The temporal patterns of photosynthesis demonstrated here highlight the physiological complexity and interdependence of the algae circadian clock associated in this symbiosis and the plasticity of algae regulatory mechanisms downstream of the circadian clock.},

abstract = {Symbiotic dinoflagellates are unicellular photosynthetic algae that live in mutualistic symbioses with many marine organisms. Within the transcriptome of coral endosymbionts Symbiodinium sp. (type C3), we discovered the sequences of two novel and highly polymorphic hemoglobin-like genes and proposed their 3D protein structures. At the protein level, four isoforms shared between 87 and 97% sequence identity for Hb-1 and 78-99% for Hb-2, whereas between Hb-1 and Hb-2 proteins, only 15-21% sequence homology has been preserved. Phylogenetic analyses of the dinoflagellate encoding Hb sequences have revealed a separate evolutionary origin of the discovered globin genes and indicated the possibility of horizontal gene transfer. Transcriptional regulation of the Hb-like genes was studied in the reef-building coral Acropora aspera exposed to elevated temperatures (6-7$\,^{\circ}$C above average sea temperature) over a 24-h period and a 72-h period, as well as to nutrient stress. Exposure to elevated temperatures resulted in an increased Hb-1 gene expression of 31% after 72 h only, whereas transcript abundance of the Hb-2 gene was enhanced by up to 59% by both 1-day and 3-day thermal stress conditions. Nutrient stress also increased gene expression of Hb-2 gene by 70%. Our findings describe the differential expression patterns of two novel Hb genes from symbiotic dinoflagellates and their polymorphic nature. Furthermore, the inducible nature of Hb-2 gene by both thermal and nutrient stressors indicates a prospective role of this form of hemoglobin in the initial coral-algal responses to changes in environmental conditions. This novel hemoglobin has potential use as a stress biomarker.},

abstract = {The equatorial Pacific Ocean atoll islands of Kiritimati and Teraina encompass great physical, chemical and biological variability within extreme lacustrine environments. Surveys of lake chemistry and sediments revealed both intra- and inter-island variability. A survey of more than 100 lakes on Kiritimati found salinities from nearly fresh to 150 ppt with the highest values occurring within the isolated, inland portions of the island away from the influence of groundwater or extreme tides. Dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH values also showed considerable variability with a less regular spatial pattern, but were both generally inversely related to salinity. Series of lakes, progressively more isolated from marine communication, present a modern analog to the chemical and morphologic evolution of presently isolated basins. Sediments on both islands consist of interbedded red and green silt, possibly degraded bacterial mat, overlying white, mineralogenic silt precipitate. Variability may be indicative of shifts in climatological parameters such as the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Pacific Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).},

abstract = {The El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives large changes in global climate patterns from year to year, yet its sensitivity to continued anthropogenic greenhouse forcing is uncertain. We analyzed fossil coral reconstructions of ENSO spanning the past 7000 years from the Northern Line Islands, located in the center of action for ENSO. The corals document highly variable ENSO activity, with no evidence for a systematic trend in ENSO variance, which is contrary to some models that exhibit a response to insolation forcing over this same period. Twentieth-century ENSO variance is significantly higher than average fossil coral ENSO variance but is not unprecedented. Our results suggest that forced changes in ENSO, whether natural or anthropogenic, may be difficult to detect against a background of large internal variability.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Corals represent symbiotic meta-organisms that require harmonization among the coral animal, photosynthetic zooxanthellae and associated microbes to survive environmental stresses. We investigated integrated-responses among coral and zooxanthellae in the scleractinian coral Acropora formosa in response to an emerging marine pollutant, the munitions constituent, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5 triazine (RDX; 5 day exposures to 0 (control), 0.5, 0.9, 1.8, 3.7, and 7.2 mg/L, measured in seawater).

RESULTS:RDX accumulated readily in coral soft tissues with bioconcentration factors ranging from 1.1 to 1.5). Next-generation sequencing of a normalized meta-transcriptomic library developed for the eukaryotic components of the A. formosa coral holobiont was leveraged to conduct microarray-based global transcript expression analysis of integrated coral / zooxanthellae responses to the RDX exposure. Total differentially expressed transcripts (DET) increased with increasing RDX exposure concentrations as did the proportion of zooxanthellae DET relative to the coral animal. Transcriptional responses in the coral demonstrated higher sensitivity to RDX compared to zooxanthellae where increased expression of gene transcripts coding xenobiotic detoxification mechanisms (i.e. cytochrome P450 and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family) were initiated at the lowest exposure concentration. Increased expression of these detoxification mechanisms was sustained at higher RDX concentrations as well as production of a physical barrier to exposure through a 40% increase in mucocyte density at the maximum RDX exposure. At and above the 1.8 mg/L exposure concentration, DET coding for genes involved in central energy metabolism, including photosynthesis, glycolysis and electron-transport functions, were decreased in zooxanthellae although preliminary data indicated that zooxanthellae densities were not affected. In contrast, significantly increased transcript expression for genes involved in cellular energy production including glycolysis and electron-transport pathways was observed in the coral animal.

CONCLUSIONS:Transcriptional network analysis for central energy metabolism demonstrated highly correlated responses to RDX among the coral animal and zooxanthellae indicative of potential compensatory responses to lost photosynthetic potential within the holobiont. These observations underscore the potential for complex integrated responses to RDX exposure among species comprising the coral holobiont and highlight the need to understand holobiont-species interactions to accurately assess pollutant impacts.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have impressively accelerated research in biological science during the last years by enabling the production of large volumes of sequence data to a drastically lower price per base, compared to traditional sequencing methods. The recent and ongoing developments in the field allow addressing research questions in plant-microbe biology that were not conceivable just a few years ago. The present review provides an overview of NGS technologies and their usefulness for the analysis of microorganisms that live in association with plants. Possible limitations of the different sequencing systems, in particular sources of errors and bias, are critically discussed and methods are disclosed that help to overcome these shortcomings. A focus will be on the application of NGS methods in metagenomic studies, including the analysis of microbial communities by amplicon sequencing, which can be considered as a targeted metagenomic approach. Different applications of NGS technologies are exemplified by selected research articles that address the biology of the plant associated microbiota to demonstrate the worth of the new methods.},

Summary: Evaluate if short-term prior thermal stress leads to increased thermal tolerance through acclimatization.

Question: How does thermal history influence the response of the coral symbiosis to thermal stress?

Methods:
Lab aquaria experiment with varying temperature stresses
PAM
Cell densities
Pigment

Results:
Symbionts of corals that were exposed to 31C for 48 h (pre-stress treatment) 1 or 2 weeks prior to a 6-day simulated bleaching event (when corals were exposed to 34 C) were found to have a more effective photo protective mechanisms (non-photochemical quenching, xanthophyll cycling).

For example, the induction of acclimatory responses has been shown to have effects on a variety of other performance measures resulting in such disparate responses as increased longevity, increased cold tolerance and decreased fertility, to list a few (Hoffman et al., 2003). A history of exposure to a range of stresses has also been found to alter subsequent higher plant responses where a priming stress activates genes that leave an epigenetic mark, facilitating a quicker response to subsequent stresses (Bruce et al., 2007). What costs and benefits accrue to the coral holobiont will need to be determined.

More specifically, they represent examples of defensive mutualism, when one species receives protection against predators or parasites in exchange for offering shelter or food to its partner species. Explores the Diverse Range of Defensive Mutualisms Involving Microbial Symbionts The past 20 years, since this phenomenon first began receiving attention, have been marked by a deluge of research in a variety of organism kingdoms and much has been discovered about this intriguing behavior. Defensive Mutualism in Microbial Symbiosis includes basic ecological and biological information on defensive mutualisms, explores how they function, and evaluates how they have evolved. It also looks at the implications of symbiosis defensive compounds as a new frontier in bioexploration for drug and natural product discovery--the first book to explore this possibility. Chapters Written by Field Authorities The book expands the concept of defensive mutualisms to evaluate defense against environmental abiotic and biotic stresses. Addressing the topic of defensive mutualisms in microbial symbiosis across this wide spectrum, it includes chapters on defensive mutualistic associations involving multiple kingdoms of organisms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems--plant, animal, fungi, bacteria, and protozoans. Defensive Mutualism in Microbial Symbiosis unifies scattered findings into a single compendium, providing a valuable reference for field researchers and those in academia to assimilate and acquire a knowledgeable perspective on defensive mutualism, particularly those involving microbial partners.},

Summary:
Survey of symbiont type of octocorals from GBR, E Pacific, and Caribbean and comparison with phylogeny of host species.

Question: How are symbionts distributed geographically, and how is their distribution influenced by the host phylogeny

Methods:
Sampled 114 spp from 69 genera (20 families) from 3 regions
ITS1 

Results: 
Octocorals have gained/lost endosymbionts several times throughout their evolution
Octocorals can with more easily between mixotrophy and heterotrophy compared to scleractinian corals (and are thus less dependent (on an evolutionary timescale) on photosynthetic carbon gain than scleractinian corals

abstract = {The presence, genetic identity and diversity of algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium) in 114 species from 69 genera (20 families) of octocorals from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the far eastern Pacific (EP) and the Caribbean was examined, and patterns of the octocoral-algal symbiosis were compared with patterns in the host phylogeny. Genetic analyses of the zooxanthellae were based on ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region. In the GBR samples, Symbiodinium clades A and G were encountered with A and G being rare. Clade B zooxanthellae have been previously reported from a GBR octocoral, but are also rare in octocorals from this region. Symbiodinium G has so far only been found in Foraminifera, but is rare in these organisms. In the Caribbean samples, only Symbiodinium clades B and C are present. Hence, Symbiodinium diversity at the level of phylogenetic clades is lower in octocorals from the Caribbean compared to those from the GBR. However, an unprecedented level of ITS1 diversity was observed within individual colonies of some Caribbean gorgonians, implying either that these simultaneously harbour multiple strains of clade B zooxanthellae, or that ITS1 heterogeneity exists within the genomes of some zooxanthellae. Intracladal diversity based on ITS should therefore be interpreted with caution, especially in cases where no independent evidence exists to support distinctiveness, such as ecological distribution or physiological characteristics. All samples from EP are azooxanthellate. Three unrelated GBR taxa that are described in the literature as azooxanthellate (Junceella fragilis, Euplexaura nuttingi and Stereonephthya sp. 1) contain clade G zooxanthellae, and their symbiotic association with zooxanthellae was confirmed by histology. These corals are pale in colour, whereas related azooxanthellate species are brightly coloured. The evolutionary loss or gain of zooxanthellae may have altered the light sensitivity of the host tissues, requiring the animals to adopt or reduce pigmentation. Finally, we superimposed patterns of the octocoral-algal symbiosis onto a molecular phylogeny of the host. The data show that many losses/gains of endosymbiosis have occurred during the evolution of octocorals. The ancestral state (azooxanthellate or zooxanthellate) in octocorals remains unclear, but the data suggest that on an evolutionary timescale octocorals can switch more easily between mixotrophy and heterotrophy compared to scleractinian corals, which coincides with a low reliance on photosynthetic carbon gain in the former group of organisms.},

abstract = {Among the many uses of hierarchical modeling, their application to the statistical analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data from areas such as epidemiology And environmental science has proven particularly fruitful. Yet to date, the few books that address the subject have been either too narrowly focused on specific aspects of spatial analysis, or written at a level often inaccessible to those lacking a strong background in mathematical statistics. Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data is the first accessible, self-contained treatment of hierarchical methods, modeling, and data analysis for spatial and spatio-temporal data. Starting with overviews of the types of spatial data, the data analysis tools appropriate for each, and a brief review of the Bayesian approach to statistics, the authors discuss hierarchical modeling for univariate spatial response data, including Bayesian kriging and lattice (areal data) modeling. They then consider the problem of spatially misaligned data, methods for handling multivariate spatial responses, spatio-temporal models, and spatial survival models. The final chapter explores a variety of special topics, including spatially varying coefficient models. This book provides clear explanations, plentiful illustrations --some in full color--a variety of homework problems, and tutorials and worked examples using some of the field's most popular software packages.. Written by a team of leaders in the field, it will undoubtedly remain the primary textbook and reference on the subject for years to come.},

Question:

Methods:
Sequence the actin gene

Results:
Were able to accurately determine both densities and ratios of multiple symbionts within one sample, "the assay will open the door for novel research into the mechanisms of symbiont shuffling and switching."
clade C had seven actin gene copies per genome, while clade D has only one .: it appears that either the actin gene alone, or larger parts (or the whole genome) has experienced duplications. ("Two important benefits can be obtained from gene duplication: increased gene expression (identical copies) and increased complexity (multi gene family).")
Realtime PCR can express symbiont densities in two ways: per-colony surface area or per-host cell (S/H ratio)

Whereas the effects of species loss on ecosystem processes have received broad attention, the consequences of altered species dominance for emergent properties of communities and ecosystems are poorly investigated. Here we propose a framework guiding our understanding of how dominance affects species interactions within communities, processes within ecosystems, and dynamics on regional scales. Dominance (or the complementary term, evenness) reflects the distribution of traits in a community, which in turn affects the strength and sign of both intraspecifc and interspecific interactions. Consequently, dominance also mediates the effect of such interactions on species coexistence. We review the evidence for the fact that dominance directly affects ecosystem functions such as process rates via species identity (the dominant trait) and e...},

Summary: Identification of Symbiodinium in corals and non associated environmental Symbiodinium

Question:What environmental Symbiodinium are available (and where are they) and how does this compare to Symbiodinium associated with the dominant reef building coral?

Methods:
ITS2 DGGE
Collected from sediment, water column, corals (mucus, milked mucus, crushed corals)

Results:
"{\ldots}Although no single environmental pool contained a Symbiodinium complement directly comparable to that of the host coral species investigated, the dominant coral Symbiodiniium were available in combinations of the environmental pools, indicating that the exchange of SYmbiodinium between the environment and corals is both spatially and temporally dynamic."
"This study demonstrates a diverse population of symbionts existing in environmental pools within the reef system, a circumstance that provides coral hosts the opportunity to interact with and potentially select from these populations"
"Specific individuals within these environmental assemblages may currently be excluded from engaging in endosymbiotic interactions with anthozoan hosts depending on such factors as geographic partitioning and rarity. However, should environmental conditions select against the current endosymbiotic complement, individuals in the environmental assemblage may be capable of exploting the newly available 'endosymbiotic niche'."

Summary: Population structure of Symbiodinium (ITS2-D1) across the eastern Pacific

Question: How are Symbiodinium populations genetically structured across 1000s km scale?

Methods:
11 microsattelite loci
Mexico, Galapagos, and Gulf of California
402 samples
Dominant symbiont identified by DGGE 5.8S ITS2

"However, population genetic studies of Symbiodinium remain few and substantially more data are needed to evaluate the generality of genetic structuring in a species' metapopulation."

Results:
Populations in Mexico and the Galapagos have extensive regional host connectivity (inferred that this pattern is because of Pocillopora dispersal)
Populations between these locations and Gulf of California were genetically distinct.
Inferred conclusion - "S. glynni genotypes harboured by host larvae arriving from more southern locations are rapidly replaced by genotypes adapted to more temperate environments."
"The strong population structure of S. glynni corresponds with fluctuating environmental conditions and suggests that these genetically diverse populations have the potential to evolve rapidly to changing environments and reveals the importance of environmental extremes in driving microbial eukaryote (e.g. plankton) speciation in marine ecosystems."
There was no subdivision of Symbiodinium across host morphospecies
"The ability of Pocillopora type 1 and S. glynni to disperse throughout uch of the eastern Pacific suggests that the shallow water ecosystems they create may be resilient to local disturbances and capable of recovery by migration of individuals from surrounding sources."

abstract = {In obligate symbioses, the host's survival relies on the successful acquisition and maintenance of symbionts. Symbionts can either be transferred from parent to offspring via direct inheritance (vertical transmission) or acquired anew each generation from the environment (horizontal transmission). With vertical symbiont transmission, progeny benefit by not having to search for their obligate symbionts, and, with symbiont inheritance, a mechanism exists for perpetuating advantageous symbionts. But, if the progeny encounter an environment that differs from that of their parent, they may be disadvantaged if the inherited symbionts prove suboptimal. Conversely, while in horizontal symbiont acquisition host survival hinges on an unpredictable symbiont source, an individual host may acquire genetically diverse symbionts well suited to any given environment. In horizontal acquisition, however, a potentially advantageous symbiont will not be transmitted to subsequent generations. Adaptation in obligate symbioses may require mechanisms for both novel symbiont acquisition and symbiont inheritance. Using denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR, we identified the dinoflagellate symbionts (genus Symbiodinium) hosted by the Red Sea coral Stylophora pistillata throughout its ontogenesis and over depth. We present evidence that S. pistillata juvenile colonies may utilize both vertical and horizontal symbiont acquisition strategies. By releasing progeny with maternally derived symbionts, that are also capable of subsequent horizontal symbiont acquisition, coral colonies may acquire physiologically advantageous novel symbionts that are then perpetuated via vertical transmission to subsequent generations. With symbiont inheritance, natural selection can act upon the symbiotic variability, providing a mechanism for coral adaptation.},

The effect might be indirect: water stress on plants can lead to carbon stress, which could alter carbon-mediated plant mutualisms. In mutualistic ant-plant symbioses, plants host ant colonies that defend them against herbivores. Here we show that the partners' investments in a widespread ant-plant symbiosis increase with water stress across 26 sites along a Mesoamerican precipitation gradient. At lower precipitation levels, Cordia alliodora trees invest more carbon in Azteca ants via phloem-feeding scale insects that provide the ants with sugars, and the ants provide better defense of the carbon-producing leaves. Under water stress, the trees have smaller carbon pools. A model of the carbon trade-offs for the mutualistic partners shows that the observed strategies can arise from the carbon costs of rare but extreme events of herbivory in the rainy season. Thus, water limitation, together with the risk of herbivory, increases the strength of a carbon-based mutualism.},

abstract = {A review of published literature on the sensitivity of corals to turbidity and sedimentation is presented, with an emphasis on the effects of dredging. The risks and severity of impact from dredging (and other sediment disturbances) on corals are primarily related to the intensity, duration and frequency of exposure to increased turbidity and sedimentation. The sensitivity of a coral reef to dredging impacts and its ability to recover depend on the antecedent ecological conditions of the reef, its resilience and the ambient conditions normally experienced. Effects of sediment stress have so far been investigated in 89 coral species (~10% of all known reef-building corals). Results of these investigations have provided a generic understanding of tolerance levels, response mechanisms, adaptations and threshold levels of corals to the effects of natural and anthropogenic sediment disturbances. Coral polyps undergo stress from high suspended-sediment concentrations and the subsequent effects on light attenuation which affect their algal symbionts. Minimum light requirements of corals range from 100 mg L(-1) in marginal nearshore reefs. Some individual coral species can tolerate short-term exposure (days) to suspended-sediment concentrations as high as 1000 mg L(-1) while others show mortality after exposure (weeks) to concentrations as low as 30 mg L(-1). The duration that corals can survive high turbidities ranges from several days (sensitive species) to at least 5-6 weeks (tolerant species). Increased sedimentation can cause smothering and burial of coral polyps, shading, tissue necrosis and population explosions of bacteria in coral mucus. Fine sediments tend to have greater effects on corals than coarse sediments. Turbidity and sedimentation also reduce the recruitment, survival and settlement of coral larvae. Maximum sedimentation rates that can be tolerated by different corals range from 400 mg cm(-2) d(-1). The durations that corals can survive high sedimentation rates range from 4 weeks of high sedimentation or >14 days complete burial) for very tolerant species. Hypotheses to explain substantial differences in sensitivity between different coral species include the growth form of coral colonies and the size of the coral polyp or calyx. The validity of these hypotheses was tested on the basis of 77 published studies on the effects of turbidity and sedimentation on 89 coral species. The results of this analysis reveal a significant relationship of coral sensitivity to turbidity and sedimentation with growth form, but not with calyx size. Some of the variation in sensitivities reported in the literature may have been caused by differences in the type and particle size of sediments applied in experiments. The ability of many corals (in varying degrees) to actively reject sediment through polyp inflation, mucus production, ciliary and tentacular action (at considerable energetic cost), as well as intraspecific morphological variation and the mobility of free-living mushroom corals, further contribute to the observed differences. Given the wide range of sensitivity levels among coral species and in baseline water quality conditions among reefs, meaningful criteria to limit the extent and turbidity of dredging plumes and their effects on corals will always require site-specific evaluations, taking into account the species assemblage present at the site and the natural variability of local background turbidity and sedimentation.},

Summary: Followed symbiont communities in S. pistillata over 2 years, including a natural bleaching event

Question: How does sub-cladal variability affect bleaching susceptibility and mortality?

Methods:
Field- tagged 46 colonies
DGGE- ITS2
Fv/Fm

Results:
Subcladal symbiont identity (within clade C) had a significant effect on the response to elevated temperatures
They didn't find a significant change in Symbiont type due to bleaching, there were a few changes, but these switched  back by the next sampling period (do not support ABH)
"However, because these symbionts mainly belonged to those naturally present within the host populations, we believe that the rapid changes in symbiont communities proposed by the ABH may be restrict to symbiont types native to the host." (Except their study doesn't necessarily rule out uptake from the environment)
"Even within this framework it appears that changes in symbiont communities are not sustained post bleaching, and permanent changes are more likely to occur over generations rather than within the life cycle of individual hosts."
"We show that community-wide shifts in symbiont dominance are caused by differential mortality of colonies harbouring sensitive versus tolerant symbiont types rather than symbiont changes within individual colonies."

"Although the Symbiodinium genetic diversity may be reduced, there is no concomitant reduction in coral host genetic diversity. In contrast, differential mortality results in a reduction of both the Symbiodinium and the coral host genetic diversity on the reef. This difference is fundamental to our understanding of coral reef community change whereby, despite the fact that more thermally tolerant individuals will occur within the population, the overall loss of biodiversity of both symbiotic partners will negatively impact the resilience as well as the ecosystem functioning of coral reefs"

abstract = {Coral bleaching has been identified as one of the major contributors to coral reef decline, and the occurrence of different symbionts determined by broad genetic groupings (clades A-H) is commonly used to explain thermal responses of reef-building corals. By using Stylophora pistillata as a model, we monitored individual tagged colonies in situ over a two-year period and show that fine level genetic variability within clade C is correlated to differences in bleaching susceptibility. Based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the internal transcribed spacer region 2, visual bleaching assessments, symbiont densities, host protein, and pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry, we show that subcladal types C78 and C8/a are more thermally tolerant than C79 and C35/a, which suffered significant bleaching and postbleaching mortality. Although additional symbiont types were detected during bleaching in colonies harboring types C79 and C35/a, all colonies reverted back to their original symbionts postbleaching. Most importantly, the data propose that the differential mortality of hosts harboring thermally sensitive versus resistant symbionts rather than symbiont shuffling/switching within a single host is responsible for the observed symbiont composition changes of coral communities after bleaching. This study therefore highlights that the use of broad cladal designations may not be suitable to describe differences in bleaching susceptibility, and that differential mortality results in a loss of both symbiont and host genetic diversity and therefore represents an important mechanism in explaining how coral reef communities may respond to changing conditions.},

abstract = {The regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) is a fundamental aspect of cell physiology that has received little attention in studies of reef-building corals and symbiotic cnidarians. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that dynamic changes in the pHi of coral host cells are controlled by the photosynthetic activity of the coral's dinoflagellate symbionts. Using live cell imaging and the pH-sensitive dye SNARF-1, we tracked pH in symbiont-containing and symbiont-free cells isolated from the reef coral Stylophora pistillata. We characterised the response of coral pHi in the presence of a photosynthetic inhibitor, the dynamics of coral pHi during light exposure and how pHi values vary on exposure to a range of irradiance levels lying within the coral's photosynthesis-irradiance response curve. Our results demonstrate that increases in coral pHi are dependent on photosynthetic activity of intracellular symbionts and that pHi recovers under darkness to values that match those of symbiont-free cells. Furthermore, we show that the timing of the pHi response is governed by irradiance level and that pHi increases to irradiance-specific steady-state values. Minimum steady-state pHi values of 7.05 $\pm$ 0.05 were obtained under darkness and maximum values of 7.46 $\pm$ 0.07 were obtained under saturating irradiance. As changes in pHi often affect organism homeostasis, there is a need for continued research into acid/base regulation in symbiotic corals. More generally, these results represent the first characterization of photosynthesis-driven pHi changes in animal cells.},

Logan Dunne Eakin and Donner 2013

Summary: Model with SST to project coral bleaching trajectories

Question: How do different adaptive processes affect bleaching projections?

Methods:
Tropical coral reef locations mapped from the millennium coral reef mapping project, adjusted to the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab Earth System Model 2 ESM2M (bias corrected for El Nino events)
4 Models
1) No adaptive response - threshold=2degDHM, fixed
2) Adaptive response to recent thermal history (genetic adaptation) - threshold=2degDHM, rolling
3) Symbiont shuffling - DHM threshold increases by 1degC after bleaching event and reverts to original threshold over 2 or 5 years
4) Transient community shifts - Same as (3) but reverts to original threshold over 10 years

Results:
"In the absence of adaptive processes, application of a preindustrial climatology to the NOAA Coral Reef Watch bleaching prediction method over predicts the present-day bleaching frequency."
Model 2 - reduced coral bleaching is possible if adaptive responses can occur
Model 3 - demonstrates that there is only limited potential for symbiont shuffling and transient community shifts to reduce coral bleaching.
Model 4 - there is a potential for additive effects in reducing future coral bleaching

"Out results highlight the importance of considering multiple adaptive processes in projections of climate warming on coral reefs."

An interesting point that they bring up is the possibility that corals respond to the rate of temperature increase more than the actual temperature itself. They then say, "If corals do respond more to the rate of change, it would have very encouraging implications for the future of coral reefs."

Problems:
(They point out) that their model does not consider variability of adaptive responses by species, depth, location etc. which will considerably affect reef ecosystem's response to climate change

abstract = {Climate warming threatens to increase mass coral bleaching events, and several studies have projected the demise of tropical coral reefs this century. However, recent evidence indicates corals may be able to respond to thermal stress though adaptive processes (e.g., genetic adaptation, acclimatization, and symbiont shuffling). How these mechanisms might influence warming induced bleaching is largely unknown. This study compared how different adaptive processes could affect coral bleaching projections. We used the latest bias-corrected global sea surface temperature (SST) output from the NOAA/GFDL Earth System Model 2 (ESM2M) for the pre-industrial period though 2100 to project coral bleaching trajectories. Initial results showed that, in the absence of adaptive processes, application of a pre-industrial climatology to the NOAA Coral Reef Watch bleaching prediction method over-predicts the present day bleaching frequency. This suggests that corals may have already responded adaptively to some warming over the industrial period. We then modified the prediction method so that the bleaching threshold either permanently increased in response to thermal history (e.g., simulating directional genetic selection) or temporarily increased for 2-10 years in response to a bleaching event (e.g., simulating symbiont shuffling). A bleaching threshold that changes relative to the preceding 60 years of thermal history reduced the frequency of mass bleaching events by 20-80% compared with the 'no adaptive response' prediction model by 2100, depending on the emissions scenario. When both types of adaptive responses were applied, up to 14% more reef cells avoided high frequency bleaching by 2100. However, temporary increases in bleaching thresholds alone only delayed the occurrence of high frequency bleaching by ~10 years in all but the lowest emissions scenario. Future research should test the rate and limit of different adaptive responses for coral species across latitudes and ocean basins to determine if and how much corals can respond to increasing thermal stress.

Summary: Quantifying bleaching under increased temperature in a dark environment

Question: Is there a non-photoassociated pathway to coral bleaching? (Can corals bleach in the dark in the absence of photosynthetically derived ROS?)

Methods: 
cultured aiptasia
coral nubbins (Acropora)
heated in the dark
cell count (fluorescence on flow cytometer)

Results:
Yes, corals can bleach in the dark
"There seems likely to be a direct benefit to the hosts of triggering bleaching during high-temperature exposure in the dark: expulsion of algae during the night would reduce the number of endosymbionts resident in the host tissue at daybreak, when photosynthetically produced ROS (or another light-dependent mechanism) would probably augment the damaging effects of elevated temperature. Thus the pathway that triggers bleaching in the dark may represent a previously unsuspected coral adaptation to life in intimate symbiosis with a partner that can become a liability under stress conditions."

abstract = {The global decline of reef-building corals is due in part to the loss of algal symbionts, or "bleaching," during the increasingly frequent periods of high seawater temperatures [1, 2]. During bleaching, endosymbiotic dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium spp.) either are lost from the animal tissue or lose their photosynthetic pigments, resulting in host mortality if the Symbiodinium populations fail to recover [3]. The >1,000 studies of the causes of heat-induced bleaching have focused overwhelmingly on the consequences of damage to algal photosynthetic processes [4-6], and the prevailing model for bleaching invokes a light-dependent generation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) by heat-damaged chloroplasts as the primary trigger [6-8]. However, the precise mechanisms of bleaching remain unknown, and there is evidence for involvement of multiple cellular processes [9, 10]. In this study, we asked the simple question of whether bleaching can be triggered by heat in the dark, in the absence of photosynthetically derived ROS. We used both the sea anemone model system Aiptasia [11, 12] and several species of reef-building corals to demonstrate that symbiont loss can occur rapidly during heat stress in complete darkness. Furthermore, we observed damage to the photosynthetic apparatus under these conditions in both Aiptasia endosymbionts and cultured Symbiodinium. These results do not directly contradict the view that light-stimulated ROS production is important in bleaching, but they do show that there must be another pathway leading to bleaching. Elucidation of this pathway should help to clarify bleaching mechanisms under the more usual conditions of heat stress in the light.},

At 26$\,^{\circ}$C, ammonium supplementation had little effect on the coral physiology. It induced a decrease in symbiont density, compensated by an increase in chlorophyll content per symbiont cell. Organic carbon release was reduced, likely because of a better utilization of the photosynthesized carbon (i.e. incorporation into proteins, kept in the coral tissue). The $\delta$(15)N signatures of the ammonium-enriched symbionts and host tissue were also significantly decreased, by 4 and 2‰, respectively, compared with the non-enriched conditions, suggesting a significant uptake of inorganic nitrogen by the holobiont. Under thermal stress, coral colonies that were not nitrogen enriched experienced a drastic decrease in photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments (chlorophyll a, $\beta$-carotene, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin and peridinin), followed by a decrease in the rates of photosynthesis and calcification. Organic carbon release was not affected by this thermal stress. Conversely, nitrogen-enriched corals showed an increase in their pigment concentrations, and maintained rates of photosynthesis and calcification at ca. 60% and 100% of those measured under control conditions, respectively. However, these corals lost more organic carbon into the environment. Overall, these results indicate that inorganic nitrogen availability can be important to determining the resilience of some scleractinian coral species to thermal stress, and can have a function equivalent to that of heterotrophic feeding concerning the maintenance of coral metabolism under stress conditions.},

abstract = {The standard approach to analyzing 16S tag sequence data, which relies on clustering reads by sequence similarity into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), underexploits the accuracy of modern sequencing technology. We present a clustering-free approach to multi-sample Illumina data sets that can identify independent bacterial subpopulations regardless of the similarity of their 16S tag sequences. Using published data from a longitudinal time-series study of human tongue microbiota, we are able to resolve within standard 97% similarity OTUs up to 20 distinct subpopulations, all ecologically distinct but with 16S tags differing by as little as one nucleotide (99.2% similarity). A comparative analysis of oral communities of two cohabiting individuals reveals that most such subpopulations are shared between the two communities at 100% sequence identity, and that dynamical similarity between subpopulations in one host is strongly predictive of dynamical similarity between the same subpopulations in the other host. Our method can also be applied to samples collected in cross-sectional studies and can be used with the 454 sequencing platform. We discuss how the sub-OTU resolution of our approach can provide new insight into factors shaping community assembly.},

abstract = {Over the past 30 years, warm thermal disturbances have become commonplace on coral reefs worldwide. These periods of anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) can lead to coral bleaching, a breakdown of the symbiosis between the host coral and symbiotic dinoflagellates which reside in coral tissue. The onset of bleaching is typically predicted to occur when the SST exceeds a local climatological maximum by 1 degrees C for a month or more. However, recent evidence suggests that the threshold at which bleaching occurs may depend on thermal history. This study uses global SST data sets (HadISST and NOAA AVHRR) and mass coral bleaching reports (from Reefbase) to examine the effect of historical SST variability on the accuracy of bleaching prediction. Two variability-based bleaching prediction methods are developed from global analysis of seasonal and interannual SST variability. The first method employs a local bleaching threshold derived from the historical variability in maximum annual SST to account for spatial variability in past thermal disturbance frequency. The second method uses a different formula to estimate the local climatological maximum to account for the low seasonality of SST in the tropics. The new prediction methods are tested against the common globally fixed threshold method using the observed bleaching reports. The results find that estimating the bleaching threshold from local historical SST variability delivers the highest predictive power, but also a higher rate of Type I errors. The second method has the lowest predictive power globally, though regional analysis suggests that it may be applicable in equatorial regions. The historical data analysis suggests that the bleaching threshold may have appeared to be constant globally because the magnitude of interannual variability in maximum SST is similar for many of the world's coral reef ecosystems. For example, the results show that a SST anomaly of 1 degrees C is equivalent to 1.73-2.94 standard deviations of the maximum monthly SST for two-thirds of the world's coral reefs. Coral reefs in the few regions that experience anomalously high interannual SST variability like the equatorial Pacific could prove critical to understanding how coral communities acclimate or adapt to frequent and/or severe thermal disturbances.},

abstract = {The Coral Triangle encompasses an extensive region of coral reefs in the western tropical Pacific with marine resources that support millions of people. As in all other reef regions, coral reefs in the Coral Triangle have been impacted by anomalously high ocean temperature. The vast majority of bleaching observations to date have been associated with the 1998 La Ni{\~n}a phase of ENSO. To understand the significance of ENSO and other climatic oscillations to heat stress in the Coral Triangle, we use a 5-km resolution Regional Ocean Model System for the Coral Triangle (CT-ROMS) to study ocean temperature thresholds and variability for the 1960-2007 historical period. Heat-stress events are more frequent during La Ni{\~n}a events, but occur under all climatic conditions, reflecting an overall warming trend since the 1970s. Mean sea surface temperature (SST) in the region increased an average of ~ 0.1 $\,^{\circ}$C per decade over the time period, but with considerable spatial variability. The spatial patterns of SST and heat stress across the Coral Triangle reflect the complex bathymetry and oceanography. The patterns did not change significantly over time or with shifts in ENSO. Several regions experienced little to no heat stress over the entire period. Of particular interest to marine conservation are regions where there are few records of coral bleaching despite the presence of significant heat stress, such as in the Banda Sea. Although this may be due to under-reporting of bleaching events, it may also be due to physical factors such as mixing and cloudiness, or biological factors that reduce sensitivity to heat stress.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals and other tropical anthozoans harbor endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. It is now recognized that the dinoflagellates are fundamental to the biology of their hosts, and their carbon and nitrogen metabolisms are linked in important ways. Unlike free living species, growth of symbiotic dinoflagellates is unbalanced and a substantial fraction of the carbon fixed daily by symbiont photosynthesis is released and used by the host for respiration and growth. Release of fixed carbon as low molecular weight compounds by freshly isolated symbiotic dinoflagellates is evoked by a factor (i.e., a chemical agent) present in a homogenate of host tissue. We have identified this "host factor" in the Hawaiian coral Pocillopora damicornis as a set of free amino acids. Synthetic amino acid mixtures, based on the measured free amino acid pools of P. damicornis tissues, not only elicit the selective release of 14C-labeled photosynthetic products from isolated symbiotic dinoflagellates but also enhance total 14CO2 fixation.},

abstract = {The performance and function of reef corals depends on the genetic identity of their symbiotic algal partners, with some symbionts providing greater benefits (e.g., photosynthate, thermotolerance) than others. However, these interaction outcomes may also depend on partner abundance, with differences in the total number of symbionts changing the net benefit to the coral host, depending on the particular environmental conditions. We suggest that symbiont abundance is a fundamental aspect of the dynamic interface between reef corals and the abiotic environment that ultimately determines the benefits, costs, and functional responses of these symbioses. This density-dependent framework suggests that corals may regulate the size of their symbiont pool to match microhabitat-specific optima, which may contribute to the high spatiotemporal variability in symbiont abundance observed within and among colonies and reefs. Differences in symbiont standing stock may subsequently explain variation in energetics, growth, reproduction, and stress susceptibility, and may mediate the impacts of environmental change on these outcomes. However, the importance of symbiont abundance has received relatively little recognition, possibly because commonly-used metrics based on surface area (e.g., symbiont cells cm(-2)) may be only weakly linked to biological phenomena and are difficult to compare across studies. We suggest that normalizing symbionts to biological host parameters, such as units of protein or numbers of host cells, will more clearly elucidate the functional role of symbiont abundance in reef coral symbioses. In this article, we generate testable hypotheses regarding the importance of symbiont abundance by first discussing different metrics and their potential links to symbiosis performance and breakdown, and then describing how natural variability and dynamics of symbiont communities may help explain ecological patterns on coral reefs and predict responses to environmental change.},

As in the clinical setting, reactive oxygen species are also important signal transduction molecules and mediators of damage in cellular processes, such as apoptosis and cell necrosis, for marine organisms.

Many aspects of this association, including the mechanistic basis of host-symbiont recognition and metabolic interaction, remain poorly understood. The first completed genome sequence for a symbiotic anthozoan is now available (the coral Acropora digitifera), and extensive expressed sequence tag resources are available for a variety of other symbiotic corals and anemones. These resources make it possible to profile gene expression, protein abundance, and protein localization associated with the symbiotic state. Here we review the history of "omics" studies of cnidarian-algal symbiosis and the current availability of sequence resources for corals and anemones, identifying genes putatively involved in symbiosis across 10 anthozoan species. The public availability of candidate symbiosis-associated genes leaves the field of cnidarian-algal symbiosis poised for in-depth comparative studies of sequence diversity and gene expression and for targeted functional studies of genes associated with symbiosis. Reviewing the progress to date suggests directions for future investigations of cnidarian-algal symbiosis that include (i) sequencing of Symbiodinium, (ii) proteomic analysis of the symbiosome membrane complex, (iii) glycomic analysis of Symbiodinium cell surfaces, and (iv) expression profiling of the gastrodermal cells hosting Symbiodinium.},

Notably, Mayr explains that Darwin's theory of evolution is actually five separate theories, each with its own history, trajectory and impact. Ernst Mayr, commonly referred to as the "Darwin of the 20th century" and listed as one of the top 100 scientists of all-time, is Professor Emeritus at Harvard University.

The evolutionary game theory developed in this 2005 book provides the tools necessary for understanding many of nature's mysteries, including co-evolution, speciation, extinction and the major biological questions regarding fit of form and function, diversity, procession, and the distribution and abundance of life. Mathematics for the evolutionary game are developed based on Darwin's postulates leading to the concept of a fitness generating function (G-function). G-function is a tool that simplifies notation and plays an important role developing Darwinian dynamics that drive natural selection. Natural selection may result in special outcomes such as the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). An ESS maximum principle is formulated and its graphical representation as an adaptive landscape illuminates concepts such as adaptation, Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, and the nature of life's evolutionary game.},

abstract = {Bursts in species diversification are well documented among animals and plants, yet few studies have assessed recent adaptive radiations of eukaryotic microbes. Consequently, we examined the radiation of the most ecologically dominant group of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates found in reef-building corals, Symbiodinium Clade C, using nuclear ribosomal (ITS2), chloroplast (psbA(ncr)), and multilocus microsatellite genotyping. Through a hierarchical analysis of high-resolution genetic data, we assessed whether ecologically distinct Symbiodinium, differentiated by seemingly equivocal rDNA sequence differences, are independent species lineages. We also considered the role of host specificity in Symbiodinium speciation and the correspondence between endosymbiont diversification and Caribbean paleo-history. According to phylogenetic, biological, and ecological species concepts, Symbiodinium Clade C comprises many distinct species. Although regional factors contributed to population-genetic structuring of these lineages, Symbiodinium diversification was mainly driven by host specialization. By combining patterns of the endosymbiont's host specificity, water depth distribution, and phylogeography with paleo-historical signals of climate change, we inferred that present-day species diversity on Atlantic coral reefs stemmed mostly from a post-Miocene adaptive radiation. Host-generalist progenitors spread, specialized, and diversified during the ensuing epochs of prolonged global cooling and change in reef-faunal assemblages. Our evolutionary reconstruction thus suggests that Symbiodinium undergoes "boom and bust" phases in diversification and extinction during major climate shifts.

Kinzie, Takayama, Santos, Coffroth 2001
Biological Bulletin 200:51-58

Summary: Tested the fundamental assumptions of the ABH: 1)Different types of zooxanthellae respond differently to environmental conditions, specifically temperature, 2) bleached adults can secondarily acquire zooxanthellae from the environment
OR Experiments relating zooxanthellae diversity to potential recovery from loss of symbionts.

Question: Is the adaptive bleaching hypothesis a reasonable explanation for bleaching recovery?

Methods:
Had Symbio growing in culture from clades A, B, and C
Infected hosts with different concentrations of Symbio
Put Aiptasia in unfiltered seawater to see if they would be infected with Symbio

Results:
1)Genetically different strains of zooxanthellae exhibit different responses to elevated temperature
2)Bleached adult hosts can acquire algal symbionts with an apparently dose-dependent relationship between the concentration of zooxanthellae and the rate of establishment of the symbiosis
3)Bleached adult hosts can acquire symbionts from the water column.
Support ABH, but more research needs to be done to confirm!

Problems:

abstract = {Coral bleaching, the loss of color due to loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae or their pigment, appears to be increasing in intensity and geographic extent, perhaps related to increasing sea surface temperatures. The adaptive bleaching hypothesis (ABH) posits that when environmental circumstances change, the loss of one or more kinds of zooxanthellae is rapidly, sometimes unnoticeably, followed by formation of a new symbiotic consortium with different zooxanthellae that are more suited to the new conditions in the host's habitat. Fundamental assumptions of the ABH include (1) different types of zooxanthellae respond differently to environmental conditions, specifically temperature, and (2) bleached adults can secondarily acquire zooxanthellae from the environment. We present simple tests of these assumptions and show that (1) genetically different strains of zooxanthellae exhibit different responses to elevated temperature, (2) bleached adult hosts can acquire algal symbionts with an apparently dose-dependent relationship between the concentration of zooxanthellae and the rate of establishment of the symbiosis, (3) and finally, bleached adult hosts can acquire symbionts from the water column.},

Summary: Genetic analyses to determine which symbionts make MAAs in several different cnidarian species, found that type A makes MAA, but B and C tend not to

Question: Do different symbiodinium phylotypes produce MAAs?

Methods: RFLP- restriction fragment length polymorphism of SSUrDNA
Treated with UV-B/A and PAR

Results: 
There is a phylogenetic relation for MAA biosynthesis
Clade A Symbiodinium (and Gymnodinium, Gloeodinium and Amphidinium) produced MAAs, but clades B and C did not

Notes about different clades:
S. microadriaticum (phylotype A) readily acclimates to high and low PAR and synthesizes MAAs, even without a UV stimulus, but has a low temperature tolerance. 
S. pilosum (phylotype A) is exclusively high-light adapted (i.e., it responds poorly to low PAR), and synthesizes MAAs, but tolerates high temperatures. 
Symbiodinium sp. from Pocillopora damicornis (phylotype B) tolerates high PAR, does not synthesize MAAs, and has a high temperature tolerance
S. pulchrorum (phylotype B) tolerates high PAR, does not synthesize MAAs, but has a lower temperature tolerance 
S. kawagutii (phylotype C) is low-light adapted (responds poorly to high PAR), does not synthesize MAAs, but has a higher temperature tolerance than S. microadriaticum, but lower than S. pilosum.


Problems:
Since they were cultured outside their hosts, it is impossible to know whether they would be morel likely to produced MAAs if they are within their host's tissues

Impressions: One of the first times people isolated different clades from one coral colony},

We exposed 27 isolates of symbiotic dinoflagellates simultaneously to UV-B/A and PAR, and subsequently determined the MAAs present in cell extracts and in the media. The algae used included 24 isolates of Symbiodinium spp. originating from jellyfishes, sea anemones, zoanthids, scleractinians, octocorals, and bivalves, and three others in the genera Gymnodinium, Gloeodinium and Amphidinium from a jellyfish, an hydrocoral and a flatworm, respectively. In this study, all of the phylotype A Symbiodinium spp. synthesized up to three identified MAAs. None of the 11 cultured phylotypes B and C Symbiodinium spp. synthesized MAAs. The three non-Symbiodinium symbionts also synthesized up to three MAAs. The results support a conclusion that phylotype A Symbiodinium spp. have a high predilection for the synthesis of MAAs, while phylotypes B and C do not. Synthesis of MAAs by symbiotic dinoflagellates in culture does not appear to relate directly to depths or to the UV exposure regimes from which the consortia were collected.},

abstract = {The distribution patterns of symbiotic algae are thought to be conferred mainly by their hosts, however, they may originate in algal environmental requirements as well. In lichens, predominantly terrestrial associations of fungi with algae or cyanobacteria, the ecological preferences of photobionts have not been directly studied so far. Here, we examine the putative environmental requirements in lichenized alga Asterochloris, and search for the existence of ecological guilds in Asterochloris-associating lichens. Therefore, the presence of phylogenetic signal in several environmental traits was tested. Phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated set of internal transcribed spacer rDNA and actin type I intron sequences from photobionts associated with lichens of the genera Lepraria and Stereocaulon (Stereocaulaceae, Ascomycota) revealed 13 moderately to well-resolved clades. Photobionts from particular algal clades were found to be associated with taxonomically different, but ecologically similar lichens. The rain and sun exposure were the most significant environmental factor, clearly distinguishing the Asterochloris lineages. The photobionts from ombrophobic and ombrophilic lichens were clustered in completely distinct clades. Moreover, two photobiont taxa were obviously differentiated based on their substrate and climatic preferences. Our study, thus reveals that the photobiont, generally the subsidiary member of the symbiotic lichen association, could exhibit clear preferences for environmental factors. These algal preferences may limit the ecological niches available to lichens and lead to the existence of specific lichen guilds.

In this paper, I review recent research into the climate-induced breakdown of this important symbiosis (namely 'coral bleaching') that challenges the validity of this long-standing belief. Indeed, I introduce a more parsimonious explanation, in which the coral host exerts a 'controlled parasitism' over its algal symbionts that is akin to an enforced domestication arrangement. Far from being pathogenic, a range of well-established cellular processes are reviewed that support the role of the coral host as an active 'farmer' of the energy-rich photoassimilates from its captive symbionts. Importantly, this new paradigm reposes the deleterious bleaching response in terms of an envelope of environmental conditions in which the exploitative and captive measures of the coral host are severely restricted. The ramification of this new paradigm for developing management strategies that may assist the evolution of bleaching resistance in corals is discussed.},

abstract = {We identified 100 scientific questions that, if answered, would have the greatest impact on conservation practice and policy. Representatives from 21 international organizations, regional sections and working groups of the Society for Conservation Biology, and 12 academics, from all continents except Antarctica, compiled 2291 questions of relevance to conservation of biological diversity worldwide. The questions were gathered from 761 individuals through workshops, email requests, and discussions. Voting by email to short-list questions, followed by a 2-day workshop, was used to derive the final list of 100 questions. Most of the final questions were derived through a process of modification and combination as the workshop progressed. The questions are divided into 12 sections: ecosystem functions and services, climate change, technological change, protected areas, ecosystem management and restoration, terrestrial ecosystems, marine ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems, species management, organizational systems and processes, societal context and change, and impacts of conservation interventions. We anticipate that these questions will help identify new directions for researchers and assist funders in directing funds.},

abstract = {Rampant illegal hunting threatens wildlife populations inside many tropical protected areas, compromising their long-term effectiveness. A critical question concerns whether such harvest has indirect effects on non-hunted organisms that interact with the game species. For example many tree species are demographically reliant on seed dispersal by vertebrates that are threatened by hunting; the anthropogenic disruption of this animal-plant mutualism can severely alter the composition of tropical forests. Here I show that illegal poaching has reduced or extirpated several mammal species from national parks in northern Thailand. This, in turn, has negatively affected the demography of the canopy tree Choerospondias axillaris, which is dependent on the dispersal of its seeds to light gaps by gibbons (Hylobates lar), sambar deer (Cervus elaphus), and muntjac deer (Muntiacus muntjak). In parks where these mammals are heavily hunted, far fewer seeds are dispersed to light gaps and seedling abundance is significantly reduced. These results suggest that anthropogenic impacts such as overharvest can indirectly ramify through communities.},

abstract = {Protective ant-plant mutualisms-where plants provide food or shelter to ants and ants protect the plants from herbivores-are a common feature in many ecological communities, but few studies have examined the effect of disturbance on these interactions. Disturbance may affect the relationship between plants and their associated ant mutualists by increasing the plants' susceptibility to herbivores, changing the amount of reward provided for the ants, and altering the abundance of ants and other predators. Pruning was used to simulate the damage to buttonwood mangrove (Conocarpus erectus) caused by hurricanes. Pruned plants grew faster than unpruned plants, produced lower levels of physical anti-herbivore defenses (trichomes, toughness), and higher levels of chemical defenses (tannins) and extrafloral nectaries. Thus, simulated hurricane damage increased plant growth and the amount of reward provided to ant mutualists, but did not have consistent effects on other anti-herbivore defenses. Both herbivores and ants increased in abundance on pruned plants, indicating that the effects of simulated hurricane damage on plant traits were propagated to higher trophic levels. Ant-exclusion led to higher leaf damage on both pruned and upruned plants. The effect of ant-exclusion did not differ between pruned and unpruned plants, despite the fact that pruned plants had higher ant and herbivore densities, produced more extrafloral nectaries, and had fewer physical defenses. Another common predator, clubionid spiders, increased in abundance on pruned plants from which ants had been excluded. I suggest that compensatory predation by these spiders diminished the effect of ant-exclusion on pruned plants.},

abstract = {Mutualistic networks are critical to biological diversity maintenance; however, their structures and functionality may be threatened by a swiftly changing world. In the Amazon, the increasing number of dams poses a large threat to biological diversity because they greatly alter and fragment the surrounding landscape. Tight coevolutionary interactions typical of tropical forests, such as the ant-myrmecophyte mutualism, where the myrmecophyte plants provide domatia nesting space to their symbiotic ants, may be jeopardized by the landscape changes caused by dams. We analyzed 31 ant-myrmecophyte mutualistic networks in undisturbed and disturbed sites surrounding Balbina, the largest Central Amazonian dam. We tested how ant-myrmecophyte networks differ among dam-induced islands, lake edges, and undisturbed forests in terms of species richness, composition, structure, and robustness (number of species remaining in the network after partner extinctions). We also tested how landscape configuration in terms of area, isolation, shape, and neighborhood alters the structure of the ant-myrmecophyte networks on islands. Ant-myrmecophytic networks were highly compartmentalized in undisturbed forests, and the compartments had few strongly connected mutualistic partners. In contrast, networks at lake edges and on islands were not compartmentalized and were negatively affected by island area and isolation in terms of species richness, density, and composition. Habitat loss and fragmentation led to coextinction cascades that contributed to the elimination of entire ant-plant compartments. Furthermore, many myrmecophytic plants in disturbed sites lost their mutualistic ant partners or were colonized by opportunistic, nonspecialized ants. Robustness of ant-myrmecophyte networks on islands was lower than robustness near lake edges and in undisturbed forest and was particularly susceptible to the extinction of plants. Beyond the immediate habitat loss caused by the building of large dams in Amazonia, persistent edge effects and habitat fragmentation associated with dams had large negative effects on animal-plant mutualistic networks.

abstract = {Large-scale high-throughput sequencing techniques are rapidly becoming popular methods to profile complex communities and have generated deep insights into community biodiversity. However, several technical problems, especially sequencing artifacts such as nucleotide calling errors, could artificially inflate biodiversity estimates. Sequence filtering for artifact removal is a conventional method for deleting error-prone sequences from high-throughput sequencing data. As rare species represented by low-abundance sequences in datasets may be sensitive to artifact removal process, the influence of artifact removal on rare species recovery has not been well evaluated in natural complex communities. Here we employed both internal (reliable operational taxonomic units selected from communities themselves) and external (indicator species spiked into communities) references to evaluate the influence of artifact removal on rare species recovery using 454 pyrosequencing of complex plankton communities collected from both freshwater and marine habitats. Multiple analyses revealed three clear patterns: 1) rare species were eliminated during sequence filtering process at all tested filtering stringencies, 2) more rare taxa were eliminated as filtering stringencies increased, and 3) elimination of rare species intensified as biomass of a species in a community was reduced. Our results suggest that cautions be applied when processing high-throughput sequencing data, especially for rare taxa detection for conservation of species at risk and for rapid response programs targeting non-indigenous species. Establishment of both internal and external references proposed here provides a practical strategy to evaluate artifact removal process.},

This major disturbance of reef ecosystems is principally induced by increases in water temperature. Since the beginning of the 1980s and the onset of global climate change, this phenomenon has been occurring at increasing rates and scales, and with increasing severity. Several studies have been undertaken in the last few years to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of coral bleaching but the jigsaw puzzle is far from being complete, especially concerning the early events leading to symbiosis breakdown. The aim of the present study was to find molecular actors involved early in the mechanism leading to symbiosis collapse.},

abstract = {Geostatistics is a branch of spatial statistics that was originally developed for the mining industry. The technique is now widely recognised as an important tool for the estimation of the abundance and distribution of natural resources. However, new developments have been required to extend its application to fisheries science, particularly in variogram estimation. This important new title describes the fundamentals of geostatistics in terms more familiar to life-scientists, and uses case studies on seven commercially important fish stocks to demonstrate its application to fisheries survey data. Comprehensive and practical advice is given on how this new method can be used to estimate the abundance (with an appropriate measure of precision) of fish stocks worldwide. Geostatistics for Estimating Fish Abundance will be of vital interest to fisheries research scientists, marine biologists, oceanographers, marine and fish ecologists, environmental scientists and experts involved in the assessment of natural animal resources. The book has been developed as a result of studies carried out by a collaborative team of international researchers expert in this area with financial support from the Commission of the European Communities, AIR specific RTD programme.

abstract = {The deterioration of coral reefs is a global environmental problem. Several hypotheses proposed to explain coral bleaching include UV-light exposure, global warming, exposure to intercontinental dust, and sewage pollution. Caffeine is the most widely consumed and excreted psychoactive drug in the world. It is a ubiquitous tracer of urban sewage, but its ecological effects are not well understood. This study tests the hypothesis that caffeine exposure associated with sewage discharge into natural waters exacerbates the effects of environmental stressors associated with coral bleaching. Other investigators working in vitro have reported that 25 mM (5 g/L) of caffeine causes bleaching through its effect on protein phosphorylation. Here, I report the effects of caffeine on four species of coral algae endosymbionts. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of caffeine for cell proliferation ranged from 30 mg/L for Clade C Symbiodinium goreaui (C) and Clade B Symbiodinium sp. from Pseudoterogorgia bipinnata (B7), to 50 mg/L for Clade A Symbiodinium microadriaticum (A), and 75 mg/L for Clade B Symbiodinium sp. from Aiptasia pallida (B6). To assess the effect of caffeine on algal proteins, I used two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and peptide mass spectrometry to identify sensitive proteins. Differential display analyses showed several up-regulated and several down-regulated polypeptides in response to caffeine exposure in all algae species tested. Specifically, 12 polypeptide spots upregulated and 37 polypeptide spots downregulated in C, 19 upregulated and 6 downregulated in B7, 14 upregulated and 13 downregulated in A, and 22 upregulated and 7 downregulated in B6. The results show that caffeine exposure (1) causes a reduction in growth of algal endosymbionts, (2) affects the heat shock proteins that are also associated with coral bleaching, and (3) affects the proteins associated with photosynthesis and glycolysis which are fundamental functions of healthy symbionts. These results demonstrate that my hypothesis concerning the effects of caffeine on the reef ecosystem cannot be rejected. There is a possibility that other chemicals in sewage effluent and additional environmental stressors act synergistically together to contribute to coral bleaching. The findings from this research are important to our understanding of human influence on the marine ecosystem, for improving wastewater treatment policies, and for better environmental management of a valuable ecosystem.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals and many other cnidarians are symbiotic with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. It has long been known that the endosymbiotic algae transfer much of their photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host and that this can provide much of the host's total energy. However, it has remained unclear which metabolite(s) are directly translocated from the algae into the host tissue. We reexamined this question in the small sea anemone Aiptasia using labeling of intact animals in the light with (13)C-bicarbonate, rapid homogenization and separation of animal and algal fractions, and analysis of metabolite labeling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found labeled glucose in the animal fraction within 2 min of exposure to (13)C-bicarbonate, whereas no significant labeling of other compounds was observed within the first 10 min. Although considerable previous evidence has suggested that glycerol might be a major translocated metabolite, we saw no significant labeling of glycerol within the first hour, and incubation of intact animals with (13)C-labeled glycerol did not result in a rapid production of (13)C-glucose. In contrast, when Symbiodinium cells freshly isolated from host tissue were exposed to light and (13)C-bicarbonate in the presence of host homogenate, labeled glycerol, but not glucose, was detected in the medium. We also observed early production of labeled glucose, but not glycerol, in three coral species. Taken together, the results suggest that glucose is the major translocated metabolite in dinoflagellate-cnidarian symbiosis and that the release of glycerol from isolated algae may be part of a stress response.},

abstract = {Removal of predators can have strong indirect effects on primary producers through trophic cascades. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are major primary producers worldwide that may be influenced by predator removal through changes in grazer composition and biomass. CCA have been most widely studied in Caribbean and temperate reefs, where cover increases with increasing grazer biomass due to removal of competitive fleshy algae. However, each of these systems has one dominant grazer type, herbivorous fishes or sea urchins, which may not be functionally equivalent. Where fishes and sea urchins co-occur, fishing can result in a phase shift in the grazing community with subsequent effects on CCA and other substrata. Kenyan reefs have herbivorous fishes and sea urchins, providing an opportunity to determine the relative impacts of each grazer type and evaluate potential human-induced trophic cascades. We hypothesized that fish benefit CCA, abundant sea urchins erode CCA, and that fishing indirectly reduces CCA cover by removing sea urchin predators. We used closures and fished reefs as a large-scale, long-term natural experiment to assess how fishing and resultant changes in communities affect CCA abundance. We used a short-term caging experiment to directly test the effects of grazing on CCA. CCA cover declined with increasing fish and sea urchin abundance, but the negative impact of sea urchin grazing was much stronger than that of fishes. Abundant sea urchins reduced the CCA growth rate to almost zero and prevented CCA accumulation. A warming event (El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation, ENSO) occurred during the 18-year study and had a strong but short-term positive effect on CCA cover. However, the effect of the ENSO on CCA was lower in magnitude than the effect of sea urchin grazing. We compare our results with worldwide literature on bioerosion by fishes and sea urchins. Grazer influence depends on whether benefits of fleshy algae removal outweigh costs of grazer-induced bioerosion. However, the cost-benefit ratio for CCA appears to change with grazer type, grazer abundance, and environment. In Kenya, predator removal leads to a trophic cascade that is expected to reduce net calcification of reefs and therefore reduce reef stability, growth, and resilience.},

Herbivory was estimated by assay and biomass methods, and both methods indicated higher herbivory in fishery closures. Despite higher herbivory, the effect of the ENSO disturbance was larger within these closures, with reefs undergoing a temporary transition from dominance by hard and soft coral to a temporary dominance of turf and erect algae that ended in the dominance of calcifying algae, massive Porites, Pocillopora and a few faviids six years after the disturbance. The fished reefs changed the least but had a greater cover of turf and erect algae and sponge shortly after the disturbance. Higher herbivory in the fishery closures reduced the abundance and persistence of herbivore-susceptible erect algae and created space and appropriate substratum for recruiting corals. Nonetheless, other post-settlement processes may have had strong influences such that annual rates of coral recovery were low ( approximately 2%) and not different between the management regimes. Recovery, as defined as and measured by the return to pre-disturbance coral cover and the dominant taxa, was slower in fishery closures than unmanaged reefs.},

abstract = {Ongoing global climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events, impacting population dynamics and community structure. There is, however, a critical lack of case studies considering how climatic perturbations affect biotic interactions. Here, we document how an obligate seed dispersal mutualism was disrupted by a temporally anomalous and meteorologically extreme interlude of unseasonably frigid weather, with accompanying snowstorms, in subtropical China, during January-February 2008. Based on the analysis of 5892 fecal samples (representing six mammalian seed dispersers), this event caused a substantial disruption to the relative seed dispersal function for the raisin tree Hovenia dulcis from prestorm 6.29 (2006) and 11.47 (2007), down to 0.35 during the storm (2008). Crucially, this was due to impacts on mammalian seed dispersers and not due to a paucity of fruit, where 4.63 fruit per branch were available in January 2008, vs. 3.73 in 2006 and 3.58 in 2007. An induced dietary shift occurred among omnivorous carnivores during this event, from the consumption fruit to small mammals and birds, reducing their role in seed dispersal substantially. Induced range shift extinguished the functionality of herbivorous mammals completely, however, seed dispersal function was compensated in part by three omnivorous carnivores during poststorm years, and thus while the mutualism remained intact it was enacted by a narrower assemblage of species, rendering the system more vulnerable to extrinsic perturbations. The storm's extended effects also had anthropogenic corollaries - migrating ungulates becoming exposed to heightened levels of illegal hunting - causing long-term modification to the seed dispersal community and mutualism dynamics. Furthermore, degraded forests proved especially vulnerable to the storm's effects. Considering increasing climate variability and anthropogenic disturbance, the impacts of such massive, aberrant events warrant conservation concern, while affording unique insights into the stability of mutualisms and the processes that structure biodiversity and mediate ecosystem dynamics.

abstract = {Seed-dispersal mutualisms have a fundamental role in regenerating natural communities. Interest in the importance of seed dispersal to plant communities has been heightened by worldwide declines in animal dispersers. One view, the 'keystone mutualist hypothesis', predicts that these human-caused losses will trigger a cascade of linked extinctions throughout the community. Implicitly, this view holds that mutualisms, such as seed dispersal, are crucial ecological interactions that maintain the structure and diversity of natural communities. Although many studies suggest the importance of mutualism, empirical evidence for community-level impacts of mutualists has remained anecdotal, and the central role of mutualism, relative to other species interactions, has long been debated in the theoretical literature. Here I report the community-level consequences of a biological invasion that disrupts important seed-dispersal mutualisms. I show that invasion of South African shrublands by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) leads to a shift in composition of the plant community, owing to a disproportionate reduction in the densities of large-seeded plants. This study suggests that the preservation of mutualistic interactions may be essential for maintaining natural communities.},

Fabina, Putnam, Franklin, Stat, Gates 2013
PLoS ONE 7(9): e44970

Summary: First coral-Symbiodinium networks to determine relationships and specificity

Question: How do coral-Symbiodinium networks interact?
Specifically, "the relative influence of the following on community stability (1) random vs. nonrandom species loss; (2) the importance of subdominant or cryptic symbionts; (3) maintaining species diversity vs. maintaining a diversity of potential associations; (4) the importance of mutualistic service vs. thermal tolerance.

Methods:
Network modelling
Simulated "extinctions" =loss of coral species or the ability to engage in symbiotic interactions

Results:
Majority of coral species and Symbio types are specialists
No one-to-one obligate relationships
Symbiont specificity is correlated with a hosts transmission mode
4 Factors that increase coral-Symbiodinium community stability:
"1) the survival of generalist hosts and symbionts maximizes potential symbiotic unions
2) elevated symbiont diversity provides redundant or complementary symbiotic functions 
3) combative symbiotic assemblages create the potential for local recolonization
4) the persistence of certain traits associate with symbiotic diversity and redundancy"
"Coral-Symbiodinium communities lose biodiversity more quickly when generalists are more sensitive to a changing climate"
"Subdominant symbionts have the potential to greatly increase the stability of coral-Symbiodinium communities"
	"Even depauperate coral assemblages can support diverse symbiont assemblages (and vice versa), indicating that impoverished communities have the potential to recover from environmental disturbances."
"Coral-Symbiodinium communities will be less stable if symbionts are selected for thermal tolerance rather than nutritional benefit"
***"Despite these advances, there is much to learn about the relationship between coral diversity and Symbiodinium diversity, as well as the functional implications of particular host-symbiont unions. These present two promising lines of research."***
"The major theme of this article is that the differential responses of coral reef taxa to environmental changes has implications for coral-Sybmiodinium community stability and a more detailed understanding of the causes and consequences is necessary."

Problems:
There's a bit of a conflict between the idea that apparent diversity increases after stress events and the idea that "coral-Symbiodinium communities may become more homogenized as the effects of climate change intensify"

abstract = {Researchers increasingly recognize the important role of mutualisms in structuring communities and view positive interactions in a community context rather than as simple pairwise interactions. Indirect effects, such as those that predators have on lower trophic levels, are a key process in community ecology. However, such top-down indirect effects have rarely been extended to mutualisms. Antagonists of one mutualist have the potential to negatively affect the second mutualist through negative effects on their partner, and the magnitude of such effects should vary with mutualism strength. Bumble bees are ecologically and economically important pollinators that are an ideal system to determine if such indirect effects play an important role in mutualisms. Bumble bees are attacked by an array of parasites and predators, and they interact with a range of plants that vary in their dependence on bumble bees for reproduction. We tested whether variation in parasitism rates by Nosema bombi, Crithidia bombi, and conopid flies correlated with reproduction of greenhouse-raised plants placed in the field. At multiple sites over two years, we studied four plant species that varied in reliance on bumble bees as pollinators. We found a consistent negative relationship between Nosema parasitism and measures of pollination for Trifolium pratense and Solanum carolinense, plant species with high bumble bee visitation, whereas Rudbeckia hirta and Daucus carota, plant species with generalized pollination, experienced no impacts of Nosema. However, both Crithidia and conopids showed inconsistent relationships with pollination service. Although these patterns are correlational, they provide evidence that parasites of bumble bees may have negative indirect effects on plants, and that mutualism strength can moderate the magnitude of such effects.},

For closely monitored groups like corals and marine mammals, reports of the frequency of epidemics and the number of new diseases have increased recently.

Such climate-mediated, physiological stresses may compromise host resistance and increase frequency of opportunistic diseases. Where documented, new diseases typically have emerged through host or range shifts of known pathogens. Both climate and human activities may have also accelerated global transport of species, bringing together pathogens and previously unexposed host populations.},

Summary: The first(?) paper published re: zooxanthellae providing nourishment to corals

Question: Do corals eat material from the environment, or do they only eat their zooxanthellae?

Methods: Stained crab meat with litmus to see where and how crab meat was digested, observed the status of whole and disintegrated zooxanthellae within the coral tissue

Problems: In retrospect, the fact that the only two options were eating things (since we now have a better understanding of the symbiosis)

Impressions: I am impressed by how much science has changed in the past 100 years. This provides an interesting perspective into how coral-symbiodinium research began.

abstract = {Flexibility in biological systems is seen as an important driver of macro-ecosystem function and stability. Spatially constrained endosymbiotic settings, however, are less studied, although environmental thresholds of symbiotic corals are linked to the function of their endosymbiotic dinoflagellate communities. Symbiotic flexibility is a hypothesized mechanism that corals may exploit to adapt to climate change. This study explores the flexibility of the coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis through quantification of Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence assemblages in a range of coral species and genera. Sequence assemblages are expressed as an index of flexibility incorporating phylogenetic divergence and relative abundance of Symbiodinium sequences recovered from the host. This comparative analysis reveals profound differences in the flexibility of corals for Symbiodinium, thereby classifying corals as generalists or specifists. Generalists such as Acropora and Pocillopora exhibit high intra- and inter-species flexibility in their Symbiodinium assemblages and are some of the most environmentally sensitive corals. Conversely, specifists such as massive Porites colonies exhibit low flexibility, harbour taxonomically narrow Symbiodinium assemblages, and are environmentally resistant corals. Collectively, these findings challenge the paradigm that symbiotic flexibility enhances holobiont resilience. This underscores the need for a deeper examination of the extent and duration of the functional benefits associated with endosymbiotic diversity and flexibility under environmental stress.},

abstract = {The growth response of the hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi has been determined, both when plant and fungus together and when only the fungus was exposed to a temperature change. Two host plant species, Plantago lanceolata and Holcus lanatus, were grown separately in pots inoculated with the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae at 20/18 degrees C (day/night); half of the pots were then transferred to 12/10 degrees C. Plant and fungal growth were determined at six sequential destructive harvests. A second experiment investigated the direct effect of temperature on the length of the extra-radical mycelium (ERM) of three mycorrhizal fungal species. Growth boxes were divided in two equal compartments by a 20 micro m mesh, allowing only the ERM and not roots to grow into a fungal compartment, which was either heated (+8 degrees C) or kept at ambient temperature. ERM length (LERM) was determined on five sampling dates. Growth of H. lanatus was little affected by temperature, whereas growth of P. lanceolata increased with temperature, and both specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length (SRL) increased independently of plant size. Percentage of colonized root (LRC) and LERM were positively correlated with temperature when in symbiosis with P. lanceolata, but differences in LRC were a function of plant biomass. Colonization was very low in H. lanatus roots and there was no significant temperature effect. In the fungal compartment LERM increased over time and was greatest for Glomus mosseae. Heating the fungal compartment significantly increased LERM in two of the three species but did not affect LRC. However, it significantly increased SRL of roots in the plant compartment, suggesting that the fungus plays a regulatory role in the growth dynamics of the symbiosis. These temperature responses have implications for modelling carbon dynamics under global climate change.},

abstract = {We investigated spatial patterns of synchrony among coral reef fish populations and environmental variables over an eight-year period on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Our aims were to determine the spatial scale of intra- and interspecific synchrony of fluctuations in abundance of nine damselfish species (genus Pomacentrus) and assess whether environmental factors could have influenced population synchrony. All species showed intraspecific synchrony among populations on reefs separated by < or =100 km, and interspecific synchrony was also common at this scale. At greater spatial scales, only four species showed intraspecific synchrony, over distances ranging from 100-300 km to 500-800 km, and no cases of interspecific synchrony were recorded. The two mechanisms most likely to cause population synchrony are dispersal and environmental forcing through regionally correlated climate (the Moran effect). Dispersal may have influenced population synchrony over distances up to 100 km as this is the expected spatial range for ecologically significant reef fish dispersal. Environmental factors are also likely to have synchronized population fluctuations via the Moran effect for three reasons: (1) dispersal could not have caused interspecific synchrony that was common over distances < or =100 km because dispersal cannot link populations of different species, (2) variations in both sea surface temperature and wind speed were synchronized over greater spatial scales (>800 km) than fluctuations in damselfish abundance (< or =800 km) and were correlated with an index of global climate variability, the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and (3) synchronous population fluctuations of most damselfish species were correlated with ENSO; large population increases often followed ENSO events. We recorded regional variations in the strength of population synchrony that we suspect are due to spatial differences in geophysical, oceanographic, and population characteristics, which act to dilute or enhance the effects of synchronizing mechanisms. We conclude that synchrony is common among Pomacentrus populations separated by tens of kilometers but less prevalent at greater spatial scales, and that environmental variation linked to global climate is likely to be a driving force behind damselfish population synchrony at all spatial scales on the Great Barrier Reef.},

Our results do not support that reduction in number of herbivores was a necessary precursor to coral reef decline and shifts to algal reefs in this system. Rather, macroalgae dominated the community for several years after this pulse disturbance with no concurrent change in herbivore populations. While results of microcosm experiments identified the importance of nutrients, especially phosphorus, in stimulating macroalgal growth, nutrient supply alone could not sustain macroalgal dominance as nutrient-stimulated growth rates in our in situ experiments never exceeded consumption rates of unprotected thalli. In addition, thalli with nutrient-enriched tissue were preferentially consumed, possibly negating the positive effects of nutrients on growth. These tropical reefs may be ideal systems to conduct experimental tests distinguishing phase shifts from alternative stable states. Shifts were initiated by a large-scale disturbance with no evidence of a changing environment except, perhaps, dilution in herbivory pressure due to increased algal cover. Community establishment was most likely stochastic, and the community was likely maintained by strongly positive interaction between macroalgal hosts and cyanobacterial epiphytes that uncoupled consumer control of community structure.},

The composition of the bryozoan assemblage from the coral reefs of Northern Bahia, Brazil were monitored annually from 1995 to 2000, allowing the investigation of the effects of this large-scale stressor on an important, diverse, yet understudied component of the coral reef system. Bryozoan samples (35 replicates/reef) were collected during April/May from four shallow bank reefs (10--40 m depth) located a few kilometres off the coast, together with measurements of the associated environmental parameters. Currently 157 species have been recorded from the study area, but significant reductions in density and diversity were apparent between pre- and post El-Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) years, multivariate analysis denoting significant changes in assemblage composition. A total of 61 species were unrecorded following the 1997--1998 ENSO event (22 species from 1997; 25 further species from 1998 and 14 more from 1999). These included several species endemic to Brazil, suggesting that the 1997--1998 ENSO has had a marked influence on the reef bryozoan community, resulting in the local extinction of several species. Bryozoan mortalities were probably initiated by elevated temperatures, but continued disappearance of species for 2 years after ENSO suggests other indirect factors are also influential. These results demonstrate that ENSO events can have severe long-term impacts on the biodiversity of coral reefs, with important conservation consequences.},

abstract = {Closely related scleractinian coral species that exhibited similar survival patterns under relatively normal field conditions responded very differently to the occurrence of an environmental disturbance. The two species studied were Porites cylindrica and Porites rus which occur in the same reef zones in shallow reef flats. Transplants of both species were evenly distributed and attached to three different types of substrate: live coral colonies of P. cylindrica, dead coral colonies (also of P. cylindrica), and epoxy coated metal grids that were raised above the sandy substrate. With the onset of above-normal water temperatures due to the El Ni{\~n}o episode of 1998, P. cylindrica transplants immediately showed signs of bleaching stress and tissue necrosis, followed by algal overgrowth and mortality soon afterwards. In contrast, transplants of P. rus bleached more slowly and suffered less mortality, with a few actually showing signs of recovery at the end of the experimental period which covered a total of 14 weeks. These differences in responses could be attributed to properties of the symbiotic zooxanthellae, of the host coral tissue itself, or both. Over-all, survival was good on the metal grids (average of 35%), and on the live coral (average of 22%). It was poor on the dead coral (average of 6%). The metal grids as well as live coral tissue apparently provided a favorable substrate for the attached coral fragments, even for those of a different species. Under the conditions of this particular study, attachment of live coral fragments on already dead colonies for the purpose of increasing live coral cover on the reef did not yield favorable results. This is an area that requires further investigation.},

Summary: Review of Symbiodinium knowledge as of 10 years ago.

Question:

Methods:

Results:
Molecular studies have shown coral-symbiont partnerships to be more flexible than previously thought
Unusual symbionts may prove critical to understanding long-term resilience 
There is a current controversy over the timescales over which symbiont change might occur
"Symbiont diversity should be explicitly incorporated into the design of coral reef Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) where resistance or resilience to bleaching is a consideration"
Symbiotinium might be the only protist to act as a keystone species.
11 named species distinguished with the morphological species concept
Sexual repro hasn't been observed, but it seems like they might
We don't really know how many Symbiodinium species there are 
Phylogeny methods - ribosomal small subunit, partial large subunit, internal transcribed spacers, 5.8S regions, cprDNA
Confusion - clade E and clade D. Probably the same clade
LaJeunesse claims that the large number of closely related sequence variants in clade C represents a rapid diversification from a single ancestral taxon.
"Functional diversity of Symbiodinium remains an important avenue of future research whose findings remain beyond the scope of a comprehensive review now"
The paradigm of host specificity is most likely an artefact of long-term culture of Symbiodinium
"By implicitly recognizing specificity as a continuous variable we can distinguish which symbionts are probable (often dominant in a host) from which symbionts are only possible (rare in a host, but possibly dominant in different circumstances or different hosts)."
Both Symbionts and hosts can be generalists or specialists. "{\ldots}a single association can be both highly flexible and highly specific, depending on which partner is being discussed."
"In fact, because exhaustive range-wide sampling of individual species has not yet been ( and probably never will be) undertaken, one might argue that we cannot as yet reject the hypothesis that all host species, at one time or another and in variously stable abundance, are able to maintain symbioses with various symbiont taxa to different degrees."
Depth zonation of Symbiodinium types is more evident in the Caribbean than the Pacific
"It remains to be seen whether additional, unusual symbionts can be found in extremely deep environments (up to 200m, the deepest records for scleractinian corals), but this may be unlikely given that extremely low-light environments can be found in shallow environments."
"Despite some well-documented cases of depth donation in (particularly Caribbean) scleractinian corals, the fact remains that most of the infraspecific diversity documented to date has not been satisfactorily explained by any unifying deterministic mechanism."
There can be a distribution of different Symbiodinium spp within one coral colony
"D  is factored in conditions where other symbionts are poorly suited{\ldots}taken together, these data indicate Symbiodinium D may be a weedy or opportunistic symbiont characteristic of recently stressed or marginal habitats, and/or bleached corals in the process of recovering their steady-state symbiont communities"
"{\ldots}an extraordinary diversity of free-living Symbiodinium remains to be identified."
Why are the symbioses in the tropical western Atlantic different than expected?
"Controversy over the role of symbiont diversity in enabling hosts to mitigate environmental change revolves largely around how quickly symbiont change within individual hosts can occur" **yes this is partially true, but doesn't take into consideration the relative benefits of different types of symbionts n host fitness under varying environmental conditions.
"However, despite these uncertainties, differences in bleaching susceptibility among different symbiont taxa have clear implications for how symbiont distributions might be applied to predicting or understanding future bleaching incidence and severity)"
Ways symbiont community structure can change
(1) differential mortality of bleaching-susceptible combinations (Darwinian adaptation)
(2) quantitative change in the relative abundance of existing symbiont communities within colonies ("shuffling")
(3) qualitative change by recombination with symbionts acquired from the environment. ("swathing")
(2 {\&}amp; 3 are part of the ABH)
"When coral reef hosts are assessed over their full range of systematic, ontogenetic, ecological and biogeographic gradients, the existence of unusual symbionts normally found nay in uncommon host taxa, larval stages, marginal environments, or at latitudinal extremes may probe critical in understanding the long-term resilience of coral reef ecosystems to environmental perturbation."

Summary:
Show that "corals containing unusual algal symbionts that are thermally tolerant and commonly associated with hihg-temperature environments are much more abundant on reefs that have been severely affected by rent climate change."

Question:
Can coral modify their symbiont communities in response by severe bleaching events? Specifically, can severe bleaching and mortality select for stable host-symbiont combination that are more thermally tolerant, and raise the overall bleaching resistance of the reef?

Methods:
Shallow samples ({\&}lt;7m)
restriction fragment length polymorphisms, large subunit ribosomal DNA

Results:
"These results indicated that corals containing thermally tolerant Symbiodinum in clade D are more abundant on reefs after episodes of severe bleaching and mortality, and that surviving coral symbioses on these reefs more closely resemble those found in high-temperature environments."

We still don't know what the mechanism behind these changes are

They mention that Porites remains common on devastated reefs, regardless of the fact that they don't harbour clade D. Interesting, because this is probably due to generalist/specifist, but they don't mention that here at all.

Summary: Found that Symbio communities are dynamic, that community composition follows gradients of environmental irradience. Followed corals before and after a bleaching event

Question: Can Symbio communities change after a bleaching event?

Methods: Symbi taxonomy by Restriction-fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) in genes encoding small ribosomal RNA (srRNA)

Results:
"Temporal and spatial variability can favour the coexistence of diverse symbionts within a host, despite the potential for destabilizing competition among them."
"For these corals, and for mutualizes in general, the ability to cope with environmental change through changes in symbiont community composition reflects the selective advantage of hosting several distinct symbionts, despite the potential for destabilizing competition among them"
"Our findings supply a precedent for this idea [that coral communities may be able to adjust to climate change]: that one species of coral can flexibly host more than one taxon of Symbio to produce symbioses with distinct ecological properties. For example, M annular is and M faveolata might adjust to a warmer Atlantic ocean by hosting more Symbiodinium A and less Symbiodinium B and C. However, long-term consequences of such replacements would depend on how they affect rates of coral growth and reproduction."

abstract = {Reef-building corals are obligate, mutualistic symbioses of heterotrophic animals and phototrophic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.). Contrary to the earlier, widely accepted belief that corals harbour only one symbiont, we found that the ecologically dominant Caribbean corals Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata can act as hosts to dynamic, multi-species communities of Symbiodinium. Composition of these communities follows gradients of environmental irradiance, implying that physiological acclimatization is not the only mechanism by which corals cope with environmental heterogeneity. The importance of this diversity was underlined by analysis of a natural episode of coral bleaching. Patterns of bleaching could be explained by the preferential elimination of a symbiont associated with low irradiance from the brightest parts of its distribution. Comparative analyses of symbionts before and after bleaching from the same corals supported this interpretation, and suggested that some corals were protected from bleaching by hosting an additional symbiont that is more tolerant of high irradiance and temperature. This 'natural experiment' suggests that temporal and spatial variability can favour the coexistence of diverse symbionts within a host, despite the potential for destabilizing competition among them.},

Summary: Transplant experiments show that bleaching is "a high-dish ecological opportunity for reef corals to rid themselves rapidly of suboptimal algae and to acquire new partners"

Question:

Methods:
Transplantation
Visual bleaching census
RFLP

Results:
"Transplanted coral species that hosted different algae at deep and shallow sites adjusted their algae distributions to their new depths only when transplanted upwards (12 of 16 colonies), and not when transplanted downwards (1 of 25 colonies)"
"Furthermore, the process of community change, which is facilitated by bleaching, may provide a window for unusual opportunistic symbionts to colonize hosts (and/or proliferate inside them), as shown by the behaviour of Symbiodinium A and D in upward-transplant experiments."
"Bleaching is an ecological gamble in that it sacrifices short-term benefits for long-term advantage. This counters conventional wisdom that bleaching is detrimental from all perspectives, and sports the role of symbionts as adaptive agents."

Methods:

Results:
"The two types responded very differently to a period of elevated temperature: type A1 increased light-driven O2 consumption but not the amount of H2O2 produced; in contrast, type B1 increased the amount of H2O2 produced without an increase in light-driven O2 consumption"
"The thermal tolerance of Symbiodinium is related to adaptive constraints associated with photosynthesis and that sensitive phylotypes are more prone to H2O2 production."
Symbio types A1 and B1 have different dark-adapted PSII photosynthetic characteristics under ambient growth
"The adaptive variability of photo physiology that exists between types must be better accounted for when making future broad scale assessments of PSII activity, photosynthesis, and bleaching in nature. Our results imply that thermally sensitive types would decrease not only the autotrophic contribution to the host metabolism but also result in a net accumulation of H2O2, a potential precursor of the bleaching response, under elevated water temperatures."

Results:
Reduces Symbiodinium species diversity form ~175- 35
"This testable alternative hypothesis indicates that, in Symbiodinium, "species" consist of clusters of closely related ITS-2 sequences diverging in from ancestral variants that are typically ecologically dominant."
"A cluster based view of Symbiodinium ITS-2 diversity improves our ability to
1) construct well-supported symbiont phylogenies
2) establish functional niches for symbiont species
3) Understand flexibility and specificity within coral-algal symbioses."
"{\ldots}many closely related Symbiodinium ITS-2 sequences represent genetic variants of the same species. Their treatment as different species undermines attempts to study the ecology and biogeography of these organisms."

Summary: Relationship between coral disease and Symbiodinium types and diversity

Question: What is the diversity of dominant symbionts associated with diseased scleractinian corals? 
Are there any Symbiodinium types that are uniquely associated with diseased tissue?
Do diseased and visually healthy tissues within the same coral colony contain different dominant symbionts?
Are particular Symbiodinium taxa correlated with host colony disease resistance or susceptibility?

Methods:
ITS2

Results:
DSS and WP do not induce symbiont community change
Doesn't appear that disease changes Symbiodinium communities
S. sidereal colonies (diseased) contain lower symbiont diversity compared to healthy conspecifics. "{\ldots}a connection exists between the Symbiodinium diversity that S. sidereal colonies host and their relative disease susceptibility."
D1a was negatively correlated to disease incidence. (me- interesting. since coral disease is often opportunistic bacteria taking advantage after a bleaching event. But if clade D comes in maybe it can stop that from happening.)

Summary: Survey of Symbiodinium types across Western Australia and comparison to a satellite temperature dataset

Question: What is the distribution of Symbiodinium along the coast of Western Australia? (and how does this correlate to temperature gradients?)
(Overarching - what are the patterns and mechanisms of hypothesized biogeographic patterns in the distribution of symbiodinium diversity."

Methods:
Sampled 19 species (16 genera)
ITS2 DGGE

Results:
Diverse and novel Symbiodinium communities are potentially here due to 
"1) the variable environmental histories of the study sites
2) the apparent genetic divergence within this genus resulting from the relative isolation of Western Australian reefs and/or
3) the frequent transport of symbionts (in hospice or free-living) from Indo-Malay reefs to W. Australia via the Leeuwin Current."

"Understudied reefs in remote and isolated areas may contain Symbiodinium diversity that has not been reported previously."

"Ultimately, the high diversity detected in this region may better result of both the influx of tropical Symbiodinium types, and their subsequent isolation and divergence under the varied and changing environmental conditions found along this continent's coastline."

We developed microsatellite markers for the broadcast spawning gorgonian octocoral Eunicea (Plexaura) flexuosa (four markers) and its dinoflagellate symbiont, Symbiodinium B1 (five markers), and used them to assess genetic connectivity, specificity and directionality of gene flow among sites in Florida, Panama, Saba and the Dominican Republic. Bayesian analyses found that most E. flexuosa from the Florida reef tract, Saba and the Dominican Republic were strongly differentiated from many E. flexuosa in Panama, with the exception of five colonies from Key West that clustered with colonies from Panama. In contrast, Symbiodinium B1 was more highly structured. At least seven populations were detected that showed patterns of isolation by distance. The symbionts in the five unusual Key West colonies also clustered with symbionts from Panama, suggesting these colonies are the result of long-distance dispersal. Migration rate tests indicated a weak signal of northward immigration from the Panama population into the lower Florida Keys. As E. flexuosa clonemates only rarely associated with the same Symbiodinium B1 genotype (and vice versa), these data suggest a dynamic host-symbiont relationship in which E. flexuosa is relatively well dispersed but likely acquires Symbiodinium B1 from highly structured natal areas prior to dispersal. Once vectored by host larvae, these symbionts may then spread through the local population, and/or host colonies may acquire different local symbiont genotypes over time.},

Methods:
Model
Looking for the response of Symbiodinium population densities to the seasonal dynamics of solar insolation and seawater temperature
Test whether phenotypic variance of symbionts is related with the capacity of montastrea to acclimatize to seawater temps

Results:
"This model shows that sustaining these "hidden" specialists becomes advantageous under thermal stress conditions, and shuffling symbionts may increase the coral's capacity to acclimatize but not adapt to climate change- induced ocean warming."

How symbiodinium are lost - "Such adjustments [to the model] are highly dependent on the outcomes of much needed physiological studies examining in hospite responses of Symbiodinium to environmental conditions and extremes."

Summary: Proposing a different way to culture Symbiodinium without contaminants

Question: Is solid media better for culturing Symbiodinium that liquid media?

Methods: Cultured Symbio on both types of media and then tested fluorescence using I-PAM

Results: Solid culture works just as well, and has fewer problems with contamination than liquid media.

abstract = {Some reef-building corals have been shown to respond to environmental change by shifting the composition of their algal symbiont (genus Symbiodinium) communities. These shifts have been proposed as a potential mechanism by which corals might survive climate stressors, such as increased temperatures. Conventional molecular methods suggest this adaptive capacity may not be widespread because few (∼25%) coral species have been found to associate with multiple Symbiodinium clades. However, these methods can fail to detect low abundance symbionts (typically less than 10-20% of the total algal symbiont community). To determine whether additional Symbiodinium clades are present, but are not detected using conventional techniques, we applied a high-resolution, real-time PCR assay to survey Symbiodinium (in clades A-D) from 39 species of phylogenetically and geographically diverse scleractinian corals. This survey included 26 coral species thought to be restricted to hosting a single Symbiodinium clade ('symbiotic specialists'). We detected at least two Symbiodinium clades (C and D) in at least one sample of all 39 coral species tested; all four Symbiodinium clades were detected in over half (54%) of the 26 symbiotic specialist coral species. Furthermore, on average, 68 per cent of all sampled colonies within a given coral species hosted two or more symbiont clades. We conclude that the ability to associate with multiple symbiont clades is common in scleractinian (stony) corals, and that, in coral-algal symbiosis, 'specificity' and 'flexibility' are relative terms: specificity is rarely absolute. The potential for reef corals to adapt or acclimatize to environmental change via symbiont community shifts may therefore be more phylogenetically widespread than has previously been assumed.},

abstract = {Many reef-building corals form symbioses with dinoflagellates from the diverse genus Symbiodinium. There is increasing evidence of functional significance to Symbiodinium diversity, which affects the coral holobiont's response to changing environmental conditions. For example, corals hosting Symbiodinium from the clade D taxon exhibit greater resistance to heat-induced coral bleaching than conspecifics hosting the more common clade C. Yet, the relatively low prevalence of clade D suggests that this trait is not advantageous in non-stressful environments. Thus, clade D may only be able to out-compete other Symbiodinium types within the host habitat when conditions are chronically stressful. Previous studies have observed enhanced photosynthesis and fitness by clade C holobionts at non-stressful temperatures, relative to clade D. Yet, carbon-centered metrics cannot account for enhanced growth rates and patterns of symbiont succession to other genetic types when nitrogen often limits reef productivity. To investigate the metabolic costs of hosting thermally tolerant symbionts, we examined the assimilation and translocation of inorganic (15)N and (13)C in the coral Acropora tenuis experimentally infected with either clade C (sub-type C1) or D Symbiodinium at 28 and 30 $\,^{\circ}$C. We show that at 28 $\,^{\circ}$C, C1 holobionts acquired 22% more (15)N than clade D. However, at 30 $\,^{\circ}$C, C1 symbionts acquired equivalent nitrogen and 16% less carbon than D. We hypothesize that C1 competitively excludes clade D in hospite via enhanced nitrogen acquisition and thus dominates coral populations despite warming oceans.},

Among the greatest of changes in our biosphere within the last century is rapid anthropogenic ocean warming. This phenomenon threatens corals with extinction, evidenced by the increasing observation of widespread mortality following mass bleaching events. There is some evidence and conjecture that coral-dinoflagellate symbioses change partnerships in response to changing external conditions over ecological and evolutionary timescales. Until now, we have been unable to ascertain the genetic identity of Symbiodinium hosted by corals prior to the rapid global change of the last century. Here, we show that Symbiodinium cells recovered from dry, century old specimens of 6 host species of octocorals contain sufficient DNA for amplification of the ITS2 subregion of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, commonly used for genotyping within this genus. Through comparisons with modern specimens sampled from similar locales we show that symbiotic associations among several species have been static over the last century, thereby suggesting that adaptive shifts to novel symbiont types is not common among these gorgonians, and perhaps, symbiotic corals in general.},

Metal contaminants, although noted as a concern, have not been closely monitored in these sensitive ecosystems, nor have their potential impacts on coral-algal symbioses been characterized. In this study, three species of laboratory-reared scleractinian corals, Acropora cervicornis, Pocillopora damicornis, and Montastraea faveolata each containing different algal symbionts (Symbiodinium A3, C1 and D1a, respectively) were exposed to copper (ranging from 2 to 20@mg/L) for 5 weeks. At the end of the exposure period, copper had accumulated in the endosymbiotic dinoflagellate (''zooxanthellae'') and animal tissue of A. cervicornis and the animal tissue of M. faveolata; however, no copper accumulation was detected in the zooxanthellae or animal tissue of P. damicornis. The three coral species exhibited significantly different sensitivities to copper, with effects occurring in A. cervicornis and P. damicornis at copper concentrations as low as 4@mg/L. Copper exposure affected zooxanthellae photosynthesis in A. cervicornis and P. damicornis, and carbonic anhydrase was significantly decreased in A. cervicornis and M. faveolata. Likewise, significant decreases in skeletal growth were observed in A. cervicornis and P. damicornis after copper exposure. Based on preliminary results, no changes in Symbiodinium communities were apparent in response to increasing copper concentration. These results indicate that the relationships between physiological/toxicological endpoints and copper accumulation between coral species differ, suggesting different mechanisms of toxicity and/or susceptibility. This may be driven, in part, by differences in the algal symbiont communities of the coral species in question.},

Unexpectedly, we found the "generalist" Symbiodinium clade C3 to be the prevalent symbiont among seven coral species from Abu Dhabi (UAE) waters. Moreover, C3 represented the only dominant symbiont type in Porites spp. from this region. The "thermotolerant" symbionts D1a and C15 were not encountered, indicating that the association with these symbionts cannot be the sole reason for the heat tolerance of Gulf corals. The association of Porites lobata with specific symbiont types (C3 vs. C15) in samples from habitats with very different temperature regimes (Abu Dhabi vs. Fiji) remained unaffected by laboratory culture. During temperature stress experiments specimens from both locations strongly downregulated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like pigments. However, the Abu Dhabi samples were less prone to bleaching and showed lower mortality.

abstract = {Since the early 1980s, episodes of coral reef bleaching and mortality, due primarily to climate-induced ocean warming, have occurred almost annually in one or more of the world's tropical or subtropical seas. Bleaching is episodic, with the most severe events typically accompanying coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which result in sustained regional elevations of ocean temperature. Using this extended dataset (25+ years), we review the short- and long-term ecological impacts of coral bleaching on reef ecosystems, and quantitatively synthesize recovery data worldwide. Bleaching episodes have resulted in catastrophic loss of coral cover in some locations, and have changed coral community structure in many others, with a potentially critical influence on the maintenance of biodiversity in the marine tropics. Bleaching has also set the stage for other declines in reef health, such as increases in coral diseases, the breakdown of reef framework by bioeroders, and the loss of critical habitat for associated reef fishes and other biota. Secondary ecological effects, such as the concentration of predators on remnant surviving coral populations, have also accelerated the pace of decline in some areas. Although bleaching severity and recovery have been variable across all spatial scales, some reefs have experienced relatively rapid recovery from severe bleaching impacts. There has been a significant overall recovery of coral cover in the Indian Ocean, where many reefs were devastated by a single large bleaching event in 1998. In contrast, coral cover on western Atlantic reefs has generally continued to decline in response to multiple smaller bleaching events and a diverse set of chronic secondary stressors. No clear trends are apparent in the eastern Pacific, the central-southern-western Pacific or the Arabian Gulf, where some reefs are recovering and others are not. The majority of survivors and new recruits on regenerating and recovering coral reefs have originated from broadcast spawning taxa with a potential for asexual growth, relatively long distance dispersal, successful settlement, rapid growth and a capacity for framework construction. Whether or not affected reefs can continue to function as before will depend on: (1) how much coral cover is lost, and which species are locally extirpated; (2) the ability of remnant and recovering coral communities to adapt or acclimatize to higher temperatures and other climatic factors such as reductions in aragonite saturation state; (3) the changing balance between reef accumulation and bioerosion; and (4) our ability to maintain ecosystem resilience by restoring healthy levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and coral recruitment. Bleaching disturbances are likely to become a chronic stress in many reef areas in the coming decades, and coral communities, if they cannot recover quickly enough, are likely to be reduced to their most hardy or adaptable constituents. Some degraded reefs may already be approaching this ecological asymptote, although to date there have not been any global extinctions of individual coral species as a result of bleaching events. Since human populations inhabiting tropical coastal areas derive great value from coral reefs, the degradation of these ecosystems as a result of coral bleaching and its associated impacts is of considerable societal, as well as biological concern. Coral reef conservation strategies now recognize climate change as a principal threat, and are engaged in efforts to allocate conservation activity according to geographic-, taxonomic-, and habitat-specific priorities to maximize coral reef survival. Efforts to forecast and monitor bleaching, involving both remote sensed observations and coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models, are also underway. In addition to these efforts, attempts to minimize and mitigate bleaching impacts on reefs are immediately required. If significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved within the next two to three decades, maximizing coral survivorship during this time may be critical to ensuring healthy reefs can recover in the long term.},

This acidification has the potential to cause significant perturbations to the physiology of ocean organisms, particularly those such as corals that build their skeletons/shells from calcium carbonate. Reduced ocean pH could also have an impact on the coral microbial community, and thus may affect coral physiology and health. Most of the studies to date have examined the impact of ocean acidification on corals and/or associated microbiota under controlled laboratory conditions. Here we report the first study that examines the changes in coral microbial communities in response to a natural pH gradient (mean pH(T) 7.3-8.1) caused by volcanic CO(2) vents off Ischia, Gulf of Naples, Italy. Two Mediterranean coral species, Balanophyllia europaea and Cladocora caespitosa, were examined. The microbial community diversity and the physiological parameters of the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) were monitored. We found that pH did not have a significant impact on the composition of associated microbial communities in both coral species. In contrast to some earlier studies, we found that corals present at the lower pH sites exhibited only minor physiological changes and no microbial pathogens were detected. Together, these results provide new insights into the impact of ocean acidification on the coral holobiont.},

abstract = {The coral holobiont is a complex assemblage of organisms spanning a diverse taxonomic range including a cnidarian host, as well as various dinoflagellate, prokaryotic and acellular symbionts. With the accumulating information on the molecular diversity of these groups, binomial species classification and a reassessment of species boundaries for the partners in the coral holobiont is a logical extension of this work and will help enhance the capacity for comparative research among studies. To aid in this endeavour, we review the current literature on species diversity for the three best studied partners of the coral holobiont (coral, Symbiodinium, prokaryotes) and provide suggestions for future work on systematics within these taxa. We advocate for an integrative approach to the delineation of species using both molecular genetics in combination with phenetic characters. We also suggest that an a priori set of criteria be developed for each taxonomic group as no one species concept or accompanying set of guidelines is appropriate for delineating all members of the coral holobiont.},

PLoS ONE 5(5): e10437

Summary: Investigated growth between clade C2 and D

Question: Do corals with type D grow more slowly than corals with type C?

Methods: 
ITS1 nrDNA
field and lab experiments

Results:
Lab: D = 29% slower than C2
Field: D = 38% slower than C2

"This study provides conclusive evidence that symbiont genotype is a significant determinant of skeletal growth rate in A. millepora but suggests that although acclimation by symbiont shuffling may improve survival; it does not necessarily represent a long term benefit to host physiology, at least in terms of growth."

abstract = {One of the principle ways in which reef building corals are likely to cope with a warmer climate is by changing to more thermally tolerant endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) genotypes. It is highly likely that hosting a more heat-tolerant algal genotype will be accompanied by tradeoffs in the physiology of the coral. To better understand one of these tradeoffs, growth was investigated in the Indo-Pacific reef-building coral Acropora millepora in both the laboratory and the field. In the Keppel Islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef this species naturally harbors nrDNA ITS1 thermally sensitive type C2 or thermally tolerant type D zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium and can change dominant type following bleaching. We show that under controlled conditions, corals with type D symbionts grow 29% slower than those with type C2 symbionts. In the field, type D colonies grew 38% slower than C2 colonies. These results demonstrate the magnitude of trade-offs likely to be experienced by this species as they acclimatize to warmer conditions by changing to more thermally tolerant type D zooxanthellae. Irrespective of symbiont genotype, corals were affected to an even greater degree by the stress of a bleaching event which reduced growth by more than 50% for up to 18 months compared to pre-bleaching rates. The processes of symbiont change and acute thermal stress are likely to act in concert on coral growth as reefs acclimatize to more stressful warmer conditions, further compromising their regeneration capacity following climate change.},

abstract = {The ability of coral reefs to survive the projected increases in temperature due to global warming will depend largely on the ability of corals to adapt or acclimatize to increased temperature extremes over the next few decades. Many coral species are highly sensitive to temperature stress and the number of stress (bleaching) episodes has increased in recent decades. We investigated the acclimatization potential of Acropora millepora, a common and widespread Indo-Pacific hard coral species, through transplantation and experimental manipulation. We show that adult corals, at least in some circumstances, are capable of acquiring increased thermal tolerance and that the increased tolerance is a direct result of a change in the symbiont type dominating their tissues from Symbiodinium type C to D. Our data suggest that the change in symbiont type in our experiment was due to a shuffling of existing types already present in coral tissues, not through exogenous uptake from the environment. The level of increased tolerance gained by the corals changing their dominant symbiont type to D (the most thermally resistant type known) is around 1-1.5 degrees C. This is the first study to show that thermal acclimatization is causally related to symbiont type and provides new insight into the ecological advantage of corals harbouring mixed algal populations. While this increase is of huge ecological significance for many coral species, in the absence of other mechanisms of thermal acclimatization/adaptation, it may not be sufficient to survive climate change under predicted sea surface temperature scenarios over the next 100 years. However, it may be enough to 'buy time' while greenhouse reduction measures are put in place.},

Differentiating the calcite delta18O record into components of temperature and local water delta18O reveals a dominant salinity signal that varied in accord with Dansgaard/Oeschger cycles over Greenland. Salinities were higher at times of high-latitude cooling and were lower during interstadials. The pattern and magnitude of the salinity variations imply shifts in the tropical Pacific ocean/atmosphere system analogous to modern El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). El Ni{\~n}o conditions correlate with stadials at high latitudes, whereas La Ni{\~n}a conditions correlate with interstadials. Millennial-scale shifts in atmospheric convection away from the western tropical Pacific may explain many paleo-observations, including lower atmospheric CO2, N2O, and CH4 during stadials and patterns of extratropical ocean variability that have tropical source functions that are negatively correlated with El Ni{\~n}o.},

Mortality was near-total to 15 m deep in northern atolls, and to > 35 m in central and southern atolls. Some reef surfaces have 'dropped' 1.5 m due to the loss of dense coral thickets. Coral bioerosion is substantial, reducing 3-D reef 'structure' and forming unconsolidated rubble. Juvenile corals are abundant, though mostly on eroding or unstable substrates, and are of less robust species. Reef fish abundance and diversity at 15 m depth remains high; species dependent on corals have diminished, while some herbivores and detritivores have increased. A new sea surface temperature (SST) data set shows that mean SST has risen 0.65 degree C since 1950. The critical SST causing the mortality in Chagos was 29.9 degrees C.},

abstract = {The cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis is arguably one of the most important within the marine environment in that it is integral to the formation of coral reefs. However, the regulatory processes that perpetuate this symbiosis remain unresolved. It is essential to understand these processes, if we are to elucidate the mechanisms that support growth and resource accumulation by coral host, and conversely, recently observed reduction and/or mortality of corals in response to rapid environmental change. This study specifically focused on one area of metabolic activity within the symbiosis, that of free fatty acid synthesis within both the dinoflagellate symbionts and cnidarian host. The main model system used was Aiptasia pulchella and Symbiodinium sp. in combination with aposymbiotic A. pulchella, the symbiotic coral Acropora millepora system and dinoflagellate culture. Fatty acids (FAs) were selected because of their multiple essential roles inclusive of energy storage (resource accumulation), membrane structure fluidity and cell signaling. The study addressed free FA lipogenesis by using a new method of enriched stable isotopic ((13)C) incorporation from dissolved inorganic carbon (DI(13)C) combined with HPLC-MS. FAs derived from DI(13)C aligned with a mixture of known lipogenesis pathways with the addition of some unusual FAs. After 120 hr, (13)C-enriched FA synthesis rates were attributed to only a complex integration of both n-3 and n-6 lipogenesis pathways within the dinoflagellate symbionts. Furthermore, there was no detectible evidence of symbiont derived enriched isotope fatty acids, catabolized (13)C derivatives or DI(13)C being directly utilized, in host late n-6 pathway long-chain FA lipogenesis. These findings do not align with a popular mutualistic translocation model with respect to the use of translocated symbiont photoassimilates in host long-chain FA lipogenesis, which has important connotations for linking nutrient sources with metabolite production and the dynamic regulation of this symbiosis.},

Question: 
1) Assess diversity of Symbiodinium in 12 coral species using ITS2 and chloroplast 23S
2) Examine host specificity in coral-Symbiodinium associations from this area
3) Compare the Symbiodinium diversity recovered from corals at Johnston Atoll with the diversity found in corals elsewhere in the Pacific

Summary: Survey of Symbiodinium diversity in M. capitata across Kaneohe Bay

Question: Where is the most variability, at the colony level, at the meter level, kilometre level?

Methods:
ITS2

Results:
majority of variance partitioning was at the colony level
Found more clade D at a "stressful" site at the outlet of Kaneohe Bay stream (but also found higher abundances 3 km from the stream mouth where there was no indication of increased stressors
Show a rarefaction curve for ITS2 sequences found in M cap colonies
No evidence for specificity between Symbio ITS2 and host mitochondrial nad5 and nuclear ATP synthetase subunit beta intron genotypes were detected
"We show that there is no standard number or Symbiodinium ITS2 clones that need to be sequenced from all clone libraries to accurately assess endosymbiont diversity in M. cap colonies."

abstract = {Endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium are fundamentally important to the biology of scleractinian corals, as well as to a variety of other marine organisms. The genus Symbiodinium is genetically and functionally diverse and the taxonomic nature of the union between Symbiodinium and corals is implicated as a key trait determining the environmental tolerance of the symbiosis. Surprisingly, the question of how Symbiodinium diversity partitions within a species across spatial scales of meters to kilometers has received little attention, but is important to understanding the intrinsic biological scope of a given coral population and adaptations to the local environment. Here we address this gap by describing the Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence assemblages recovered from colonies of the reef building coral Montipora capitata sampled across K{\=a}ne'ohe Bay, Hawai'i. A total of 52 corals were sampled in a nested design of Coral Colony(Site(Region)) reflecting spatial scales of meters to kilometers. A diversity of Symbiodinium ITS2 sequences was recovered with the majority of variance partitioning at the level of the Coral Colony. To confirm this result, the Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence diversity in six M. capitata colonies were analyzed in much greater depth with 35 to 55 clones per colony. The ITS2 sequences and quantitative composition recovered from these colonies varied significantly, indicating that each coral hosted a different assemblage of Symbiodinium. The diversity of Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence assemblages retrieved from individual colonies of M. capitata here highlights the problems inherent in interpreting multi-copy and intra-genomically variable molecular markers, and serves as a context for discussing the utility and biological relevance of assigning species names based on Symbiodinium ITS2 genotyping.},

abstract = {Symbioses are widespread in nature and occur along a continuum from parasitism to mutualism. Coral-dinoflagellate symbioses are defined as mutualistic because both partners receive benefit from the association via the exchange of nutrients. This successful interaction underpins the growth and formation of coral reefs. The symbiotic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium is genetically diverse containing eight divergent lineages (clades A-H). Corals predominantly associate with clade C Symbiodinium and to a lesser extent with clades A, B, D, F, and G. Variation in the function and interactive physiology of different coral-dinoflagellate assemblages is virtually unexplored but is an important consideration when developing the contextual framework of factors that contribute to coral reef resilience. In this study, we present evidence that clade A Symbiodinium are functionally less beneficial to corals than the dominant clade C Symbiodinium and may represent parasitic rather than mutualistic symbionts. Our hypothesis is supported by (i) a significant correlation between the presence of Symbiodinium clade A and health-compromised coral; (ii) a phylogeny and genetic diversity within Symbiodinium that suggests a different evolutionary trajectory for clade A compared with the other dominant Symbiodinium lineages; and (iii) a significantly lower amount of carbon fixed and released by clade A in the presence of a coral synthetic host factor as compared with the dominant coral symbiont lineage, clade C. Collectively, these data suggest that along the symbiotic continuum the interaction between clade A Symbiodinium and corals may be closer to parasitism than mutualism.},

abstract = {A detailed understanding of how diversity in endosymbiotic dinoflagellate communities maps onto the physiological range of coral hosts is critical to predicting how coral reef ecosystems will respond to climate change. Species-level taxonomy of the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium has been predominantly examined using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal array (rDNA ITS2) and downstream screening for dominant types using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Here, ITS2 diversity in the communities of Symbiodinium harboured by two Hawaiian coral species was explored using direct sequencing of clone libraries. We resolved sixfold to eightfold greater diversity per coral species than previously reported, the majority of which corresponds to a novel and distinct phylogenetic lineage. We evaluated how these sequences migrate in DGGE and demonstrate that this method does not effectively resolve this diversity. We conclude that the Porites spp. examined here harbour diverse assemblages of novel Symbiodinium types and that cloning and sequencing is an effective methodological approach for resolving the complexity of endosymbiotic dinoflagellate communities harboured by reef corals.},

Summary: Explored Symbiodinium diversity and specificity of high-latitude coral communities

Question: How do assemblages of holobiont communitites (Symbiodinium + host) differ in high latitudes vs. tropical reefs?

Methods:
PCR-DGGE ITS2

Results:
"Besides 'host-generalist' Symbiodinium types C1 and C3 approximately 72% of the Symbiodinium identified were novel C types, and donation of symbionts in relations to environmental parameters such as depth and turbidity was evident in certain host species."
"Although host specificity was maintained in certain species, others shared symbionts and this potential reduction of fidelity at high-latitude locations may be there result of locally challenging and highly variable environmental conditions."
**"Turbidity was the primary predictive environmental parameter for all host species and although the parameters of depth, salinity and temperature had varying effects, they were correlated with each other indicating that the affects of each parameter on symbiont distributions could not be distinguished."
"Whilst ITS-level 'host specificity' has previously bee reported to be greatest in unstable and isolated environments, the relaxation of 'host specificity' at the high-latitude isolated sites in the present study suggests the opposite."

Summary: Quantified the response to thermal stress in two species of coral with different symbionts

Question: Is the thermal tolerance of the host just as important as the thermal tolerance of the symbiont in determining colony persistence?

Methods:
ITS2
PAM (Fv/Fm)
Immunoblots
HSP SOD
MAA
Glycerol and lipid levels
mucus output
DNA damage

Results:
"P cylindric contains a heat resistant C15 Symbiodinium and critical host proteins are present at higher concentrations than observed for S pistillata, the combination of which provides greater protection from bleaching conditions of high temperature in the light."
Both the host and the symbiont matter in determining response to heat stress
"An important point is that the different light environments within the tissues and skeletons of these corals may drive much larger physiological differences than simply the genetics of the symbiont."

abstract = {To understand the flexibility of symbiotic associations in coral reefs, we investigated the specificity of the Aiptasia (cf. insignis)-Symbiodinium association in the laboratory by rendering the anemones aposymbiotic and inoculating them with different isolates of SYMBIODINIUM: Infective algal symbionts were monitored over 3 months by re-isolation and identification using denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence comparison of their amplified 18S rRNA hypervariable V1 + V2 gene region. Despite similarity in their external morphology, the algal isolates differed in their infectivity towards the host. Within days of single-isolate inoculation, aposymbiotic anemones formed associations with fresh or cultured isolates (clade B) from the anemones Aiptasia sp. or A. tagetes, respectively. They associated to a limited extent with cultured isolates (clade A) from the tridacnids Tridacna crocea or Hippopus hippopus, and not at all with a cultured isolate (clade C) from the stony coral Montipora verrucosa, nor with a free-living isolate (clade A) from subtidal sands. Aposymbiotic anemones inoculated with a mixture of all isolates had only the anemone taxon as their detectable symbionts. Re-inoculation of induced symbioses with a mixture of all isolates and incubation with wild anemones showed that the initial induced symbioses with the anemone taxon were stable. Anemones originally infected with tridacnid isolates either additionally acquired the anemone taxon or had the former outgrown by the latter. These results demonstrate the presence of a host-symbiont recognition mechanism, and possibly competition among potential algal symbionts in the Aiptasia-Symbiodinium association. Here we present a method that may be useful in monitoring the algal population dynamics in symbiotic corals in the field, along with an efficient method of rendering Aiptasia aposymbiotic for further laboratory investigation of Aiptasia-Symbiodinium symbioses.},

abstract = {The ecological success of shallow-water reef-building corals (Hexacorallia: Scleractinia) is framed by their intimate endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium (zooxanthellae). In contrast, the closely related black corals (Hexacorallia: Anthipatharia) are described as azooxanthellate (lacking Symbiodinium), a trait thought to reflect their preference for low-light environments that do not support photosynthesis. We examined 14 antipatharian species collected between 10 and 396 m from Hawai'i and Johnston Atoll for the presence of Symbiodinium using molecular typing and histology. Symbiodinium internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region sequences were retrieved from 43 per cent of the antipatharian samples and 71 per cent of the examined species, and across the entire depth range. The ITS-2 sequences were identical or very similar to those commonly found in shallow-water scleractinian corals throughout the Pacific. Histological analyses revealed low densities of Symbiodinium cells inside antipatharian gastrodermal tissues (0-92 cells mm(-3)), suggesting that the Symbiodinium are endosymbiotic. These findings confirm that the capacity to engage in endosymbiosis with Symbiodinium is evolutionarily conserved across the cnidarian subclass Hexacorallia, and that antipatharians associate with Symbiodinium types found in shallow-water scleractinians. This study represents the deepest record for Symbiodinium to date, and suggests that some members of this dinoflagellate genus have extremely diverse habitat preferences and broad environmental ranges.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium are best known as endosymbionts of corals and other invertebrate as well as protist hosts, but also exist free-living in coastal environments. Despite their importance in marine ecosystems, less than 10 loci have been used to explore phylogenetic relationships in this group, and only the multi-copy nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2 have been used to characterize fine-scale genetic diversity within the nine clades (A-I) that comprise the genus. Here, we describe a three-step molecular approach focused on 1) identifying new candidate genes for phylogenetic analysis of Symbiodinium spp., 2) characterizing the phylogenetic relationship of these candidate genes from DNA samples spanning eight Symbiodinium clades (A-H), and 3) conducting in-depth phylogenetic analyses of candidate genes displaying genetic divergences equal or higher than those within the ITS-2 of Symbiodinium clade C. To this end, we used bioinformatics tools and reciprocal comparisons to identify homologous genes from 55,551 cDNA sequences representing two Symbiodinium and six additional dinoflagellate EST libraries. Of the 84 candidate genes identified, 7 Symbiodinium genes (elf2, coI, coIII, cob, calmodulin, rad24, and actin) were characterized by sequencing 23 DNA samples spanning eight Symbiodinium clades (A-H). Four genes displaying higher rates of genetic divergences than ITS-2 within clade C were selected for in-depth phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that calmodulin has limited taxonomic utility but that coI, rad24, and actin behave predictably with respect to Symbiodinium lineage C and are potential candidates as new markers for this group. The approach for targeting candidate genes described here can serve as a model for future studies aimed at identifying and testing new phylogenetically informative genes for taxa where transcriptomic and genomics data are available.},

Summary: Investigate protein metabolism as a mechanism underlying acclimatization responses in reef corals, explore relationship between protein turnover, metabolic rate, growth rate, and acclimatization capacity

Question:

Methods: "Corals with low growth rates and high metabolic rates, such as the massive species, acclimatize more effectively than those with high growth rates and low metabolic rates,a feature that is characteristic of branching species. 

Results:
"This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that individual coral colonies differ in their rates of protein turnover, tissue growth, and capacity acclimatize to changing environmental conditions"
"At this point, our understanding of the biogeographical forces governing the taxonomic composition of coral symbiosis is limited. However, there is no doubt that the existence of multiple Symbiodinium clades, each potentially exhibiting a different physiological optima, provides corals with the opportunity to attain an expanded range of physiological flexibility which will ultimately be reflected in their response to environmental challenge."

Problems:

Impressions: 
"The organismic response to physical change is affected by both the magnitude of the change and the rate at which the environment shifts."
Literature Review missed the advent of understanding the role of MAA in screening UV radiation and protecting corals from cellular and molecular damage.
Also missed the first papers discussing increased incidence of bleaching in fast growing branching species as compared to the slower growing massives (Suharsono and Brown 1990, Jokiel and Coles 1990, Glynn 1993, Brown 1997a)
Was Ruth the first person to call Symbiodinium taxa "clades" (haven't seen it before this paper)

Summary of Calavetta 1998 - "Corals that bleach less readily have high concentrations of symbionts, chlorophyll and soluble protein (per unit area), and contain dinoflagellates whose physiology is characterized by high photosynthetic efficiency and low saturation irradience. Conversely, corals that exhibit a greater propensity to bleach contain dinoflagellates with lower photosynthetic efficiency that require higher saturation irradiences},

abstract = {As new sequencing technologies become cheaper and older ones disappear, laboratories switch vendors and platforms. Validating the new setups is a crucial part of conducting rigorous scientific research. Here we report on the reliability and biases of performing bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon paired-end sequencing on the MiSeq Illumina platform. We designed a protocol using 50 barcode pairs to run samples in parallel and coded a pipeline to process the data. Sequencing the same sediment sample in 248 replicates as well as 70 samples from alkaline soda lakes, we evaluated the performance of the method with regards to estimates of alpha and beta diversity. Using different purification and DNA quantification procedures we always found up to 5-fold differences in the yield of sequences between individually barcodes samples. Using either a one-step or a two-step PCR preparation resulted in significantly different estimates in both alpha and beta diversity. Comparing with a previous method based on 454 pyrosequencing, we found that our Illumina protocol performed in a similar manner - with the exception for evenness estimates where correspondence between the methods was low. We further quantified the data loss at every processing step eventually accumulating to 50% of the raw reads. When evaluating different OTU clustering methods, we observed a stark contrast between the results of QIIME with default settings and the more recent UPARSE algorithm when it comes to the number of OTUs generated. Still, overall trends in alpha and beta diversity corresponded highly using both clustering methods. Our procedure performed well considering the precisions of alpha and beta diversity estimates, with insignificant effects of individual barcodes. Comparative analyses suggest that 454 and Illumina sequence data can be combined if the same PCR protocol and bioinformatic workflows are used for describing patterns in richness, beta-diversity and taxonomic composition.},

Summary: Survey of pigment composition of healthy coral colonies

Question: What is the extent of pigment variability exhibited by healthy corals? Is pigment variability related to genetic identity of phenotypic characteristics of the symbionts?

Methods:
HPLC
18s nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) RFLP
Flow cytometry 

Results:
Pigment concentrations ranged from 1.5-10 folding colonies of each species at similar depths
Pigment ratios were relatively conserved
Flow cytometry - fluorescence and side scatter properties revealed phenotypically distinct symbiont subpopulations in every colony. "The symbiont subpopulations displayed pigment trends that may be riven by acclimatization to irradiance micro environments within the host 
"The possibility that irradiance micro environments within the host are driving the symbiont subpopulation characteristics requires future study, and may help aid in understanding interactions between symbionts and their hosts."
There was no pattern between genotype and subpopulation (supporting the idea of microenviornment partitioning in the symbiont community.

abstract = {The demarcation of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from complex sequence data sets is a key step in contemporary studies of microbial ecology. However, as biologically motivated 'optimal' OTU-binning algorithms remain elusive, many conceptually distinct approaches continue to be used. Using a global data set of 887 870 bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences, we objectively quantified biases introduced by several widely employed sequence clustering algorithms. We found that OTU-binning methods often provided surprisingly non-equivalent partitions of identical data sets, notably when clustering to the same nominal similarity thresholds; and we quantified the resulting impact on ecological data description for a well-defined human skin microbiome data set. We observed that some methods were very robust to varying clustering thresholds, while others were found to be highly susceptible even to slight threshold variations. Moreover, we comprehensively quantified the impact of the choice of 16S rRNA gene subregion, as well as of data set scope and context on algorithm performance. Our findings may contribute to an enhanced comparability of results across sequence-processing pipelines, and we arrive at recommendations towards higher levels of standardization in established workflows.

abstract = {Spatially intimate symbioses, such as those between scleractinian corals and unicellular algae belonging to the genus Symbiodinium, can potentially adapt to changes in the environment by altering the taxonomic composition of their endosymbiont communities. We quantified the spatial relationship between the cumulative frequency of thermal stress anomalies (TSAs) and the taxonomic composition of Symbiodinium in the corals Montipora capitata, Porites lobata, and Porites compressa across the Hawaiian archipelago. Specifically, we investigated whether thermally tolerant clade D Symbiodinium was in greater abundance in corals from sites with high frequencies of TSAs. We recovered 2305 Symbiodinium ITS2 sequences from 242 coral colonies in lagoonal reef habitats at Pearl and Hermes Atoll, French Frigate Shoals, and Kaneohe Bay, Oahu in 2007. Sequences were grouped into 26 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 12 OTUs associated with Montipora and 21 with Porites. Both coral genera associated with Symbiodinium in clade C, and these co-occurred with clade D in M. capitata and clade G in P. lobata. The latter represents the first report of clade G Symbiodinium in P. lobata. In M. capitata (but not Porites spp.), there was a significant correlation between the presence of Symbiodinium in clade D and a thermal history characterized by high cumulative frequency of TSAs. The endogenous community composition of Symbiodinium and an association with clade D symbionts after long-term thermal disturbance appear strongly dependent on the taxa of the coral host.},

Description of molecular techniques:    For example, RFLP provides a rapid way of describing taxonomy at the cladal level, DGGE has been used broadly to screen for ecologically dominant types, qPCR measures the relative abundance of one or two members in a mixed community, and sequencing of bacterially cloned rDNA al- lows the diversity of all Symbiodinium sequences present in a mixed sample to be characterized. Each molecular technique has methodological pros and cons (see Sampayo et al., 2009), and they are generally used to address very different questions.

abstract = {Parental effects are ubiquitous in nature and in many organisms play a particularly critical role in the transfer of symbionts across generations; however, their influence and relative importance in the marine environment has rarely been considered. Coral reefs are biologically diverse and productive marine ecosystems, whose success is framed by symbiosis between reef-building corals and unicellular dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. Many corals produce aposymbiotic larvae that are infected by Symbiodinium from the environment (horizontal transmission), which allows for the acquisition of new endosymbionts (different from their parents) each generation. In the remaining species, Symbiodinium are transmitted directly from parent to offspring via eggs (vertical transmission), a mechanism that perpetuates the relationship between some or all of the Symbiodinium diversity found in the parent through multiple generations. Here we examine vertical transmission in the Hawaiian coral Montipora capitata by comparing the Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence assemblages in parent colonies and the eggs they produce. Parental effects on sequence assemblages in eggs are explored in the context of the coral genotype, colony morphology, and the environment of parent colonies. Our results indicate that ITS2 sequence assemblages in eggs are generally similar to their parents, and patterns in parental assemblages are different, and reflect environmental conditions, but not colony morphology or coral genotype. We conclude that eggs released by parent colonies during mass spawning events are seeded with different ITS2 sequence assemblages, which encompass phylogenetic variability that may have profound implications for the development, settlement and survival of coral offspring.},

Human activities alter the natural disturbance regimes of coral reefs by transforming pulse events into persistent disturbance or even chronic stress, by introducing new disturbance, or by suppressing or removing disturbance. Adding these alterations to natural disturbance regimes will probably result in unknown synergistic effects. Simultaneously, humans are altering the capacity of reefs to cope with disturbance (e.g. by habitat fragmentation and reduction of functional diversity), which further exacerbates the effects of altered disturbance regimes. A disturbance that previously triggered the renewal and development of reefs might, under such circumstances, become an obstacle to development. The implications of these changes for reef-associated human activities, such as fishing and tourism, can be substantial.},

Significant levels of taxonomic diversity in both partners result in numerous possible combinations of coral-Symbiodinium associations with unique functional characteristics. We created and analyzed the first coral-Symbiodinium networks utilizing a global dataset of interaction records from coral reefs in the tropical Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans for 1991 to 2010. Our meta-analysis reveals that the majority of coral species and Symbiodinium types are specialists, but failed to detect any one-to-one obligate relationships. Symbiont specificity is correlated with a host's transmission mode, with horizontally transmitting corals being more likely to interact with generalist symbionts. Globally, Symbiodinium types tend to interact with only vertically or horizontally transmitting corals, and only a few generalist types are found with both. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between symbiont specificity, symbiont transmission mode, and community partitioning. The structure and dynamics of these network interactions underlie the fundamental biological partnership that determines the condition and resilience of coral reef ecosystems.},

The novelty of this application lies in the combination of a variety of query and visualization tools, including dynamic searchable maps, data tables with filter and grouping functions, and interactive charts that summarize the data. Importantly, this application is hosted remotely or 'in the cloud' using Google Apps, and therefore does not require any specialty GIS, web programming or data programming expertise from the user. The current version of the application utilizes Symbiodinium data based on the ITS2 genetic marker from PCR-based techniques, including denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, sequencing and cloning of specimens collected during 1982-2010. All data elements of the application are also downloadable as spatial files, tables and nucleic acid sequence files in common formats for desktop analysis. The application provides a unique tool set to facilitate research on the basic biology of Symbiodinium and expedite new insights into their ecology, biogeography and evolution in the face of a changing global climate.

abstract = {In comparison to some corals, massive Porites spp. is physiologically resilient to environmental assaults and is becoming more abundant on coral reefs. To evaluate the extent to which thick tissues contribute to this physiological resilience, we tested the hypothesis that the Symbiodinium in Porites lutea are phenotypically and genetically homogeneous with regard to their distribution vertically within the tissue, and in their response to temperature. Symbiodinium density, genetic identity, and photophysiology were compared between outer and inner tissues defined as adjacent layers ∼2 mm thick and beneath the skeleton surface. Symbiodinium densities were 5-fold greater and their cells contained less chlorophyll a in outer versus inner tissue, but ITS2 sequence identities were genetically uniform between layers. Maximum photochemical efficiency (F(v)/F(m)) in inner and outer tissue from the top and sides of the corals differed 6%-7%, with F(v)/F(m) greater in inner versus outer tissue on the top of colonies. On the tops of colonies, the initial slopes of the rETR versus irradiance relationship were not different between tissue layers, although they tended to be less steep for inner tissue. When exposed for 12 h to 28 $\,^{\circ}$C, 30 $\,^{\circ}$C, or 32 $\,^{\circ}$C at ∼700 $\mu$mol quanta m(-2) s(-1), there was a trend for F(v)/F(m) of the Symbiodinium in both tissue layers to be reduced at 32 $\,^{\circ}$C. Our results do not conform well to shade acclimatization in inner versus outer tissue of P. lutea, and they imply within-tissue heterogeneity that may be an important determinant of physiological performance in perforate corals.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the El Ni{\~n}o in the coral reef bleaching events of the Andaman region. Both Ni{\~n}o 3.4 and 3 indices were examined to find out the relationship between the mass bleaching events and El Ni{\~n}o, and correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Andaman Sea. The result shows that abnormal warming and mass bleaching events in the Andaman Sea were seen only during strong El Ni{\~n}o years of 1997-1998 and 2009-2010. The Andaman Sea SST was more elevated and associated with El Ni{\~n}o Modoki (central Pacific El Ni{\~n}o) than conventional El Ni{\~n}o (eastern Pacific El Ni{\~n}o) occurrences. It is suggested that the development of hot spot patterns around the Andaman Islands during May 1998 and April-May 2010 may be attributed to zonal shifts in the Walker circulation driven by El Ni{\~n}o during the corresponding period.},

Summary:

Question:

Methods:
Resilience defined as - " the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed, and recovered from, before ecosystem functions are lost and there are shifts from one stable state to another."

Four Focus Areas
1) How studies of the past can be used to predict the future
2) Genetic connectivity
3) Molecular markers for coral stress
4) The role and genetic identification of coral-inhabiting algal endosymbionts

Talks about all the problems with current sequencing techniques. (Written by Ruth)

"This band position has been characterized for a genomic profile by sequencing as ITS2 type C15 (LaJeunesse et al. 2004), and the prominence of this band in multiple genomic profiles has driven the discussion that P. lobata and P. lutea harbour a single symbiont. Data by Apprill {\&}amp; Gates (unpublished) do not, however, support this conclu- sion and indicate there is `stacking' of sequences at this position on the DGGE gels, and that novel and potentially divergent ITS2 sequence types have been overlooked."

abstract = {Coral reefs have suffered long-term decline due to a range of anthropogenic disturbances and are now also under threat from climate change. For appropriate management of these vulnerable and valuable ecosystems it is important to understand the factors and processes that determine their resilience and that of the organisms inhabiting them, as well as those that have led to existing patterns of coral reef biodiversity. The scleractinian (stony) corals deposit the structural framework that supports and promotes the maintenance of biological diversity and complexity of coral reefs, and as such, are major components of these ecosystems. The success of reef-building corals is related to their obligate symbiotic association with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. These one-celled algal symbionts (zooxanthellae) live in the endodermal tissues of their coral host, provide most of the host's energy budget and promote rapid calcification. Furthermore, zooxanthellae are the main primary producers on coral reefs due to the oligotrophic nature of the surrounding waters. In this review paper, we summarize and critically evaluate studies that have employed genetics and/or molecular biology in examining questions relating to the evolution and ecology of reef-building corals and their algal endosymbionts, and that bear relevance to coral reef conservation. We discuss how these studies can focus future efforts, and examine how these approaches enhance our understanding of the resilience of reef-building corals.},

Summary: Comparison of multiple biological attributes that are correlated with skeletal architecture 

Question: Do coral morphotypes define host-symbiont dynamics?

***Good figure with differences between foliose, massive, and branching coral types (with gross morphology, light microscopy, structural drawing and confocal microscopy)***

Methods:
Physiological metrics
Light and confocal microscopy
Stable isotope analysis
Assay for superoxide ions
Inorganic carbon and nitrogen assimilation

Results:
"Our results reveal inherent biological heterogeneity among corals and the potential for perforate skeletons to create complex, three-dimensional internal habitats that impact the dynamics of the symbiosis."
"Patterns of tissue thickness are correlated with the concentration of symbionts within narrow regions of tissue in imperforate corals versus broad distribution throughout the larger tissue area in perforate corals."
"We hypothesize that the complexity of the visually obscured internal environment has an impact on host-symbiont dynamics and ultimately on survival, warranting further scientific investigation."
**"Our findings demonstrate that although massive macro architectures might suggest that the internal architecture of P lobata is simple, in fact it is not. As a result intercalating, deep tissues create a habitat within P lobata that is unique among the coral morphotypes investigated, a key biological feature that in combination with other correlated attributed may explain some of the ecological variation among corals."

abstract = {Scleractinian corals vary in response to rapid shifts in the marine environment and changes in reef community structure post-disturbance reveal a clear relationship between coral performance and morphology. With exceptions, massive corals are thought to be more tolerant and branching corals more vulnerable to changing environmental conditions, notably thermal stress. The typical responses of massive and branching coral taxa, respectively, are well documented; however, the biological and functional characteristics that underpin this variation are not well understood. We address this gap by comparing multiple biological attributes that are correlated with skeletal architecture in two perforate (having porous skeletal matrices with intercalating tissues) and two imperforate coral species (Montipora aequituberculata, Porites lobata, Pocillopora damicornis, and Seriatopora hystrix) representing three morphotypes. Our results reveal inherent biological heterogeneity among corals and the potential for perforate skeletons to create complex, three-dimensional internal habitats that impact the dynamics of the symbiosis. Patterns of tissue thickness are correlated with the concentration of symbionts within narrow regions of tissue in imperforate corals versus broad distribution throughout the larger tissue area in perforate corals. Attributes of the perforate and environmentally tolerant P. lobata were notable, with tissues ∼5 times thicker than in the sensitive, imperforate species P. damicornis and S. hystrix. Additionally, P. lobata had the lowest baseline levels of superoxide and Symbiodinium that provisioned high levels of energy. Given our observations, we hypothesize that the complexity of the visually obscured internal environment has an impact on host-symbiont dynamics and ultimately on survival, warranting further scientific investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Mesophotic corals (light-dependent corals in the deepest half of the photic zone at depths of 30-150 m) provide a unique opportunity to study the limits of the interactions between corals and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. We sampled Leptoseris spp. in Hawaii via manned submersibles across a depth range of 67-100 m. Both the host and Symbiodinium communities were genotyped, using a non-coding region of the mitochondrial ND5 intron (NAD5) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2), respectively.

RESULTS:Coral colonies harbored endosymbiotic communities dominated by previously identified shallow water Symbiodinium ITS2 types (C1_ AF333515, C1c_ AY239364, C27_ AY239379, and C1b_ AY239363) and exhibited genetic variability at mitochondrial NAD5.

CONCLUSION:This is one of the first studies to examine genetic diversity in corals and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates sampled at the limits of the depth and light gradients for hermatypic corals. The results reveal that these corals associate with generalist endosymbiont types commonly found in shallow water corals and implies that the composition of the Symbiodinium community (based on ITS2) alone is not responsible for the dominance and broad depth distribution of Leptoseris spp. The level of genetic diversity detected in the coral NAD5 suggests that there is undescribed taxonomic diversity in the genus Leptoseris from Hawaii.},

abstract = {Resistance to endoparasitoids in aphids involves complex interactions between insect and microbial players. It is now generally accepted that the facultative bacterial symbiont Hamiltonella defensa of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum is implicated in its resistance to the parasitoid Aphidius ervi. It has also been shown that heat negatively affects pea aphid resistance, suggesting the thermosensitivity of its defensive symbiosis. Here we examined the effects of heat and UV-B on the resistance of A. pisum to A. ervi and we relate its stability under heat stress to different facultative bacterial symbionts hosted by the aphid. For six A. pisum clones harboring four different facultative symbiont associations, the impact of heat and UV-B was measured on their ability to resist A. ervi parasitism under controlled conditions. The results revealed that temperature strongly affected resistance, while UV-B did not. As previously shown, highly resistant A. pisum clones singly infected with H. defensa became more susceptible to parasitism after exposure to heat. Interestingly, clones that were superinfected with H. defensa in association with a newly discovered facultative symbiont, referred to as PAXS (pea aphid X-type symbiont), not only remained highly resistant under heat stress, but also expressed previously unknown, very precocious resistance to A. ervi compared to clones with H. defensa alone. The prevalence of dual symbiosis involving PAXS and H. defensa in local aphid populations suggests its importance in protecting aphid immunity to parasitoids under abiotic stress.},

Rowan and Powers 1991
Science 251(4999):1348-1351

Summary: First study to genetically analyze lineages of zooxanthellae from a variety (22) of hosts

Question: How many zooxanthellae types are there, and how are they distributed among species (is do all species have the same type? does each species have its own type?)

Methods:
Characterized the use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) that encode small ribosomal subunit RNA (ssRNA).

Results:
6 RFLPs were found
Individual hosts only contained one algal RFLP
"Closely related algae were found in dissimilar hosts, suggesting that animal and algal lineages have maintained a flexible evolutionary relation with each other"
"Our data suggest an intermediate hypothesis, with ten putative algal taxa distributed among 22 hosts. Ten taxa is a minimum estimate because closely related species might have similar or identical ssRNA sequences."

Problems:

Impressions: 
One of the first papers to distinguish "Symbio" instead of just "zoox"
Is this the origin of calling Symbio A, B, C{\ldots} etc?
It seems weird to me that they didn't find any apparent recombinants (i.e. each coral taxon only had one ssRNA RFLP) - because now we know that each coral species can have several different types. Maybe they picked only specifist species (unlikely) or their sample populations were connected/same environmental conditions allowed for homogenous zoox types for each species (but they took samples in Hawaii and St. Croix) or this method does not allow for pinpointing Symbio taxa?

"Symbiosis recombination is not without precedent, having been achieved in the laboratory by allowing different zooxanthella strains to infect animals that had been rendered nonsymbiotic by experimental methods (3, 6). Hosts that are briefly nonsymbiotic in nature, such as planula larvae that do not inherit their parent's algae (3) and adults affected in bleaching epidemics(25), might provide a natural opportunity for symbioses to recombine. Since animal and zooxanthella metabolisms probably interact to their mutual benefit (4), mechanisms for recombining hosts and symbionts should be favored in the same way that genomic recombination is favored (26). Many Cnidarian life histories are dominated by clonal phases that should facilitate the propagation of new combinations (27). This could occur along geographical or ecological, as well as temporal, scales."

To determine whether the planktonic veligers can acquire these algae from the environment, they were exposed to freshly isolated Symbiodinium from adult S. gigas (homologous). The optimal stage for Symbiodinium inoculation was found at 48 h post-hatching. Survival and growth rates of veligers and juveniles were higher when inoculated with freshly isolated Symbiodinium in conjunction with daily feeding of Isochrysis spp. Veligers inoculated with Symbiodinium freshly isolated from three host species elicited distinct responses: (1) veligers did not take up Symbiodinium isolated from the hydrozoan Millepora alcicornis suggesting that there is discrimination on contact prior to ingestion, (2) veligers did take up Symbiodinium isolated from the anemone Bartholomea annulata, but the algae did not persist in the host tissue suggesting that selection against this type took place after ingestion or that the algae did not divide in the host, and (3) veligers did take up Symbiodinium isolated from Pterogorgia anceps where it persisted and was associated with metamorphosis of the larvae. In contrast, the Symbiodinium freshly isolated from S. gigas were not associated with metamorphosis and required an inducer such as the red alga Laurencia poitei.

Marine Pollution Bulletin 46: 385-392

Summary: Explanatory framework for the causes of bleaching: external factors or triggers of bleaching, the symptoms, the mechanisms which define the response of the symbiosis to the triggers

Question: What are the causes of bleaching? What are the reasons for variation in susceptibility to bleaching? Why, at the evolutionary level, do corals bleach?
Why does the apparently deleterious trait of bleaching persist in Symbiodinium symbioses?

Methods:

Results:
"What is not clear is whether bleaching in response to different triggers and occurring in different symbioses involve common mechanistic components{\ldots} [if it's not], then bleaching becomes an "umbrella' term for several or multiple disparate syndromes; to pursue the jigsaw metaphor used above, studying the mechanisms of bleaching would be like trying to solve more than one puzzle simultaneously"
Two perspective for viewing determinants of variation in bleaching susceptibility:  molecular ecology of Symbiodinium, ecophysiology of corals
Prediction 1: "Symbiodinium ribotypes A and D are anticipated to be favoured over rivotype C and possibly B in some animal species subjected to bleaching episodes This may result in a shift oin the dominiont Symbiodinium ribotype to A/D in some species, and increased abundance of species capable of forming a symbiosis with these ribotypes."
Prediction 2: "Symbioses that bleach in response to elevated temperature/irradiance and survive are anticipated to be more tolerant of subsequent episodes of elevated temperature/irradiance without a shift in the complement of Symbiodinium cells, as a result of physiological acclimation.."
The adaptive bleaching hypothesis is unproven

Problems:

Impressions: 
"Everyone knows about coral bleaching"
This was probably a bit of a shocker, as it questions everything everyone was thinking about bleaching (adaptive bleaching hypothesis) at the time (and kind of still now)},

abstract = {Bleaching refers to the loss of colour in symbioses between dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium and marine benthic animals, e.g. corals. Bleaching generally results in depressed growth and increased mortality, and it can be considered as a deleterious physiological response or ailment. An explanatory framework for the causes of bleaching comprises three elements: the external factors or triggers of bleaching, e.g. elevated temperature; the symptoms, including elimination of algal cells and loss of algal pigment; and the mechanisms, which define the response of the symbiosis to the triggers, resulting in the observed symptoms. The extent to which bleaching in different symbioses and in response to different triggers involves common mechanisms is currently unknown, but a contribution of interactions between the algal and animal partners to bleaching is predicted. Symbioses vary in their susceptibility to bleaching as a result of genetic variation in Symbiodinium and acclimatory responses of the animal. The evolutionary explanation for bleaching is obscure. Perhaps, bleaching was of selective advantage to the animal hosts under different (more benign?) environmental conditions than the present, or bleaching may be a negative by-product of an otherwise advantageous symbiotic trait, such as the elimination of damaged algal cells.},

Summary: First study to look at bleaching from the algae's perspective, rather than the host kicking out the algae during times of stress.

Question: How does temperature affect the photosynthetic capabilities of Symbio and how does this affect the dissociation of algal-invertebrate symbioses in response to elevated temperature?

Methods: Symbio were cultured, 

Results:
Symbio photosynthesis is impaired at 30degC, and completely ceases at about 34degC - Symbio are directly affected by elevated temperatures
"Any mechanistic model for thermal bleaching in symbiotic reef-dwelilng invertebrates must include the algae as an integral component"
"It should be emphasized that the disassociation of algal-invertebrate symbioses appears to be in response to extremes in environmental conditions. The fact that these symbioses involve taxonomically diverse algae and hosts would suggest that different associations possess different levels of tolerance to changes in environmental parameters.
"Algal photosynthesis is of major trophy significance to symbiotic invertebrates, and hence a reduction or cessation in the movement of metabolites from algae to hosts could potentially result in disruption of the interactions between them."

In past studies of this "bleaching" phenomenon, there has been an underlying assumption that temperature adversely affects the animal hosts, the algae thereby being relegated to a more passive role. Because photosynthesis is a sensitive indicator of thermal stress in plants and has a central role in the nutrition of symbiotic invertebrates, we have tested the hypothesis that elevated temperature adversely affects photosynthesis in the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium microadriaticum. The results, based on analyses of light-mediated O2 evolution and in vivo fluorescence, indicate that photosynthesis is impaired at temperatures above 30 degrees C and ceases completely at 34-36 degrees C. These observations are discussed in the context of possible mechanisms that may function in the disassociation of algal-invertebrate symbioses in response to elevated temperature.},

abstract = {Scleractinian corals are the major builders of the complex structural framework of coral reefs. They live in tropical waters around the globe where they are frequently exposed to potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The eggs and early embryonic stages of some coral species are highly buoyant and remain near the sea surface for prolonged periods of time and may therefore be the most sensitive life stages with respect to UVR. Here, we analysed gene expression changes in five developmental stages of the Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata to natural levels of UVR using high-density cDNA microarrays (10 930 clones). We found that larvae exhibit low sensitivity to natural levels of UVR during early development as reflected by comparatively few transcriptomic changes in response to UVR. However, we identified a time window of high UVR sensitivity that coincides with the motile planula stage and the onset of larval competence. These processes have been shown to be affected by UVR exposure, and the transcriptional changes we identified explain these observations well. Our analysis of differentially expressed genes indicates that UVR alters the expression of genes associated with stress response, the endoplasmic reticulum, Ca(2+) homoeostasis, development and apoptosis during the motile planula stage and affects the expression of neurogenesis-related genes that are linked to swimming and settlement behaviour at later stages. Taken together, our study provides further data on the impact of natural levels of UVR on coral larvae. Furthermore, our results might allow a better prediction of settlement and recruitment rates after coral spawning events if UVR climate data are taken into account.},

abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are forming the most wide-spread mycorrhizal relationships on Earth. Mycorrhiza contributes to phosphorous acquisition, water absorption and resistance to diseases. The fungus promotes the absorption of nutrients and water from soil, meanwhile the host plant offers photosynthetic assimilates in exchange, like carbohydrates, as energy source. The plant benefits from the contribution of symbiotic partner only when nutrients are in low concentrations in soil and the root system would not be able to absorb sufficiently the minerals. When the help of mycorrhizal fungi is not necessarily needed, the host plant is making an economy of energy, suppressing the development of fungi in the internal radicular space. In this moment, the nature of relationship turns from symbiotic to parasitic, triggering a series of defensive reactions from the plant. Also, there were several cases reported when the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi negatively influenced the host plant. For example, in adverse environmental conditions, like very high temperatures, instead of determining a higher plant biomass and flowering, the mycorrhiza reduces the growth of the host plant. We conducted a pot experiment with hydroponic culture to examine the effect of arbuscular mycorrhiza on development of French marigold as a host plant. As experimental variants, the phosphorous content in nutrient medium and temperature varied. Plants were artificially infected with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi using a commercial inoculum containing three fungal species, as following: Glomus intraradices, Glomus etunicatum and Glomus claroideum. Colonization intensity and arbuscular richness were checked using root staining with aniline blue and estimation with the Trouvelot method. To observe the differences between plants from the experimental variants, we examined the number of side shoots, flower buds and fully developed flowers, fresh biomass and total leaf area. Results show that adverse climatic conditions, like temperature shock at the beginning of growing period modified the nature of symbiosis. In this case, the physiological parameters were reduced at colonized plants, while usual, constant growing conditions permitted the normal, efficient and beneficial development of symbiosis.},

abstract = {A departure from mainstream biology, the idea of symbiosis - as in the genetic andmetabolic interactions of the bacterial communities that became the earliest eukaryotes andeventually evolved into plants and animals - has attracted the attention of a growing number ofscientists.These original contributions by symbiosis biologists and evolutionary theorists addressthe adequacy of the prevailing neo-Darwinian concept of evolution in the light of growing evidencethat hereditary symbiosis, supplemented by the gradual accumulation of heritable mutation, resultsin the origin of new species and morphological novelty. They include reports of current research onthe evolutionary consequences of symbiosis, the protracted physical association between organisms ofdifferent species. Among the issues considered are individuality and evolution, microbial symbioses,animal-bacterial symbioses, and the importance of symbiosis in cell evolution, ecology, andmorphogenesis.Lynn Margulis, Distinguished Professor of Botany at the University of Massachusetts atAmherst, is the modern originator of the symbiotic theory of cell evolution. Once considered heresy,her ideas are now part of the microbiological revolution.

abstract = {The operational taxonomic unit (OTU) is widely used in microbial ecology. Reproducibility in microbial ecology research depends on the reliability of OTU-based 16S ribosomal subunit RNA (rRNA) analyses.
Here, we report that many hierarchical and greedy clustering methods produce unstable OTUs, with membership that depends on the number of sequences clustered. If OTUs are regenerated with additional sequences or samples, sequences originally assigned to a given OTU can be split into different OTUs. Alternatively, sequences assigned to different OTUs can be merged into a single OTU. This OTU instability affects alpha-diversity analyses such as rarefaction curves, beta-diversity analyses such as distance-based ordination (for example, Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)), and the identification of differentially represented OTUs. Our results show that the proportion of unstable OTUs varies for different clustering methods. We found that the closed-reference method is the only one that produces completely stable OTUs, with the caveat that sequences that do not match a pre-existing reference sequence collection are discarded.
As a compromise to the factors listed above, we propose using an open-reference method to enhance OTU stability. This type of method clusters sequences against a database and includes unmatched sequences by clustering them via a relatively stable de novo clustering method. OTU stability is an important consideration when analyzing microbial diversity and is a feature that should be taken into account during the development of novel OTU clustering methods.},

Most coral reefs are moderately to severely degraded by local human activities such as fishing and pollution as well as global change, hence it is difficult to separate local from global effects. To this end, we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure, and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes associated with human activities. We found that top predators and reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus, protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming.},

A relatively small number of different populations dominate all samples, but thousands of low-abundance populations account for most of the observed phylogenetic diversity. This "rare biosphere" is very ancient and may represent a nearly inexhaustible source of genomic innovation.

Summary: Recorded recovery of corals after the 1987 caribbean bleaching event

Question: 

Methods: Chl a content, ash-free dry weight, proteins and lipid measurements

Results:"Although recovery of zooxanthellae density may occur in less than one year, regrowth of tissue biomass and energy stores lost during the period of low symbiont densities may take significantly longer"
"Field observations of pigmentation and colour hue were fairly accurate indicators of zooanthellae density"
"This study shows that tissue biomass of the reef-building coral M annular is recovered at a slower rate than their algal symbionts following the Caribbean bleaching event of 1987"
"Our interpretation is that zooxanthellae remaining after a bleaching event lie in a nutrient-rich intracellular habitat and grow relatively faster than zooxanthellae in corals with higher densities of zooxanthellae."
"The evidence presented here, Glynn's (1984) observations of eventual death of bleached corals that had no healthy zooxanthellae remaining, and numerous observations of rapid recovery of bleached corals containing zooxanthellae, argue for regrowth of zooxanthellae primarily from algae remaining in the host after bleaching."

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Scleractinian corals and their algal endosymbionts (genus Symbiodinium) exhibit distinct bathymetric distributions on coral reefs. Yet, few studies have assessed the evolutionary context of these ecological distributions by exploring the genetic diversity of closely related coral species and their associated Symbiodinium over large depth ranges. Here we assess the distribution and genetic diversity of five agariciid coral species (Agaricia humilis, A. agaricites, A. lamarcki, A. grahamae, and Helioseris cucullata) and their algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium) across a large depth gradient (2-60 m) covering shallow to mesophotic depths on a Caribbean reef.

RESULTS:The five agariciid species exhibited distinct depth distributions, and dominant Symbiodinium associations were found to be species-specific, with each of the agariciid species harbouring a distinct ITS2-DGGE profile (except for a shared profile between A. lamarcki and A. grahamae). Only A. lamarcki harboured different Symbiodinium types across its depth distribution (i.e. exhibited symbiont zonation). Phylogenetic analysis (atp6) of the coral hosts demonstrated a division of the Agaricia genus into two major lineages that correspond to their bathymetric distribution ("shallow": A. humilis / A. agaricites and "deep": A. lamarcki / A. grahamae), highlighting the role of depth-related factors in the diversification of these congeneric agariciid species. The divergence between "shallow" and "deep" host species was reflected in the relatedness of the associated Symbiodinium (with A. lamarcki and A. grahamae sharing an identical Symbiodinium profile, and A. humilis and A. agaricites harbouring a related ITS2 sequence in their Symbiodinium profiles), corroborating the notion that brooding corals and their Symbiodinium are engaged in coevolutionary processes.

CONCLUSIONS:Our findings support the hypothesis that the depth-related environmental gradient on reefs has played an important role in the diversification of the genus Agaricia and their associated Symbiodinium, resulting in a genetic segregation between coral host-symbiont communities at shallow and mesophotic depths.},

Inshore reefs in the Florida Keys experience higher temperatures than offshore reefs for prolonged periods during the summer. We conducted a common garden experiment with heat stress as our selective agent to test for local thermal adaptation in corals from inshore and offshore reefs. We show that inshore corals are more tolerant of a 6-week temperature stress than offshore corals. Compared with inshore corals, offshore corals in the 31 $\,^{\circ}$C treatment showed significantly elevated bleaching levels concomitant with a tendency towards reduced growth. In addition, dinoflagellate symbionts (Symbiodinium sp.) of offshore corals exhibited reduced photosynthetic efficiency. We did not detect differences in the frequencies of major (>5%) haplotypes comprising Symbiodinium communities hosted by inshore and offshore corals, nor did we observe frequency shifts ('shuffling') in response to thermal stress. Instead, coral host populations showed significant genetic divergence between inshore and offshore reefs, suggesting that in Porites astreoides, the coral host might play a prominent role in holobiont thermotolerance. Our results demonstrate that coral populations inhabiting reefs <10-km apart can exhibit substantial differences in their physiological response to thermal stress, which could impact their population dynamics under climate change.},

abstract = {Climate warming affects the phenology, local abundance and large-scale distribution of plants and pollinators. Despite this, there is still limited knowledge of how elevated temperatures affect plant-pollinator mutualisms and how changed availability of mutualistic partners influences the persistence of interacting species. Here we review the evidence of climate warming effects on plants and pollinators and discuss how their interactions may be affected by increased temperatures. The onset of flowering in plants and first appearance dates of pollinators in several cases appear to advance linearly in response to recent temperature increases. Phenological responses to climate warming may therefore occur at parallel magnitudes in plants and pollinators, although considerable variation in responses across species should be expected. Despite the overall similarities in responses, a few studies have shown that climate warming may generate temporal mismatches among the mutualistic partners. Mismatches in pollination interactions are still rarely explored and their demographic consequences are largely unknown. Studies on multi-species plant-pollinator assemblages indicate that the overall structure of pollination networks probably are robust against perturbations caused by climate warming. We suggest potential ways of studying warming-caused mismatches and their consequences for plant-pollinator interactions, and highlight the strengths and limitations of such approaches.},

At today's level of approximately 387 ppm, allowing a lag-time of 10 years for sea temperatures to respond, most reefs world-wide are committed to an irreversible decline. Mass bleaching will in future become annual, departing from the 4 to 7 years return-time of El Ni{\~n}o events. Bleaching will be exacerbated by the effects of degraded water-quality and increased severe weather events. In addition, the progressive onset of ocean acidification will cause reduction of coral growth and retardation of the growth of high magnesium calcite-secreting coralline algae. If CO(2) levels are allowed to reach 450 ppm (due to occur by 2030-2040 at the current rates), reefs will be in rapid and terminal decline world-wide from multiple synergies arising from mass bleaching, ocean acidification, and other environmental impacts. Damage to shallow reef communities will become extensive with consequent reduction of biodiversity followed by extinctions. Reefs will cease to be large-scale nursery grounds for fish and will cease to have most of their current value to humanity. There will be knock-on effects to ecosystems associated with reefs, and to other pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Should CO(2) levels reach 600 ppm reefs will be eroding geological structures with populations of surviving biota restricted to refuges. Domino effects will follow, affecting many other marine ecosystems. This is likely to have been the path of great mass extinctions of the past, adding to the case that anthropogenic CO(2) emissions could trigger the Earth's sixth mass extinction.},

abstract = {Molecular microbial ecology investigations often employ large marker gene datasets, for example, ribosomal RNAs, to represent the occurrence of single-cell genomes in microbial communities. Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies enable extensive surveys of marker gene libraries that sometimes include nearly identical sequences. Computational approaches that rely on pairwise sequence alignments for similarity assessment and de novo clustering with de facto similarity thresholds to partition high-throughput sequencing datasets constrain fine-scale resolution descriptions of microbial communities. Minimum Entropy Decomposition (MED) provides a computationally efficient means to partition marker gene datasets into 'MED nodes', which represent homogeneous operational taxonomic units. By employing Shannon entropy, MED uses only the information-rich nucleotide positions across reads and iteratively partitions large datasets while omitting stochastic variation. When applied to analyses of microbiomes from two deep-sea cryptic sponges Hexadella dedritifera and Hexadella cf. dedritifera, MED resolved a key Gammaproteobacteria cluster into multiple MED nodes that are specific to different sponges, and revealed that these closely related sympatric sponge species maintain distinct microbial communities. MED analysis of a previously published human oral microbiome dataset also revealed that taxa separated by less than 1% sequence variation distributed to distinct niches in the oral cavity. The information theory-guided decomposition process behind the MED algorithm enables sensitive discrimination of closely related organisms in marker gene amplicon datasets without relying on extensive computational heuristics and user supervision.},

abstract = {Cnidarian bleaching is a breakdown in the mutualistic symbiosis between host Cnidarians, such as reef building corals, and their unicellular photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts. Bleaching is caused by a variety of environmental stressors, most notably elevated temperatures associated with global climate change in conjunction with high solar radiation, and it is a major contributor to coral death and reef degradation. This review examines the underlying cellular events that lead to symbiosis dysfunction and cause bleaching, emphasizing that, to date, we have only some pieces of a complex cellular jigsaw puzzle. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by damage to both photosynthetic and mitochondrial membranes, is shown to play a central role in both injury to the partners and to inter-partner communication of a stress response. Evidence is presented that suggests that bleaching is a host innate immune response to a compromised symbiont, much like innate immune responses in other host-microbe interactions. Finally, the elimination or exit of the symbiont from host tissues is described through a variety of mechanisms including exocytosis, host cell detachment and host cell apoptosis.},

Summary: 

Question: How does photosynthetic response to variations in photon flux density vary by species.

Methods: cultured symbio, P-I curves, pigment analyses

Results:
3 species possess different photosynthetic characteristics
3 species acclimate to low photon flux density by simultaneously increasing the number and size of their PSU
PSU characteristics were not correlated with the parameters of their respective P-I curves
3 species analyzed have different photo-acclimatory capabilities which can be correlated with their respective ecological distribution as endosymbionts
"the results presented here suggest that the role of photo-adaptatation as an important axis of niche diversification in reef corals should be reassessed.

Problems: Looked only at species that could be cultured independent of the host

Question:How does light level affect the chlorophyll-protein complexes, and does it differ between different types of symbio?

Methods: Algal cultures, isolation of chl-protein complexes, spectroscopic analyses, pigment analyses, immunoblot analyses

Results: "Each species demonstrated a characteristic photo-acclimatory response which correlates with its distribution as endosymbiont in nature, supporting the concept that different species of symbiotic dinoflagellates are adapted to different photic environments"

abstract = {The photosynthetic pigments of phototrophic microorganisms cover different regions of the solar light spectrum. Utilization of the light spectrum can be interpreted in terms of classical niche theory, as the light spectrum offers opportunities for niche differentiation and allows coexistence of species absorbing different colors of light. However, which spectral niches are available for phototrophic microorganisms? Here, we show that the answer is hidden in the vibrations of the water molecule. Water molecules absorb light at specific wavebands that match the energy required for their stretching and bending vibrations. Although light absorption at these specific wavelengths appears only as subtle shoulders in the absorption spectrum of pure water, these subtle shoulders create large gaps in the underwater light spectrum due to the exponential nature of light attenuation. Model calculations show that the wavebands between these gaps define a series of distinct niches in the underwater light spectrum. Strikingly, these distinct spectral niches match the light absorption spectra of the major photosynthetic pigments on our planet. This suggests that vibrations of the water molecule have played a major role in the ecology and evolution of phototrophic microorganisms.},

abstract = {Emerging diseases have been responsible for the death of about 30% of corals worldwide during the last 30 years. Coral biologists have predicted that by 2050 most of the world's coral reefs will be destroyed. This prediction is based on the assumption that corals can not adapt rapidly enough to environmental stress-related conditions and emerging diseases. Our recent studies of the Vibrio shiloi/Oculina patagonica model system of the coral bleaching disease indicate that corals can indeed adapt rapidly to changing environmental conditions by altering their population of symbiotic bacteria. These studies have led us to propose the Coral Probiotic Hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that a dynamic relationship exists between symbiotic microorganisms and environmental conditions which brings about the selection of the most advantageous coral holobiont. Changing their microbial partners would allow the corals to adapt to changing environmental conditions more rapidly (days to weeks) than via mutation and selection (many years). An important outcome of the Probiotic Hypothesis would be development of resistance of the coral holobiont to diseases. The following evidence supports this hypothesis: (i) Corals contain a large and diverse bacterial population associated with their mucus and tissues; (ii) the coral-associated bacterial population undergoes a rapid change when environmental conditions are altered; and (iii) although lacking an adaptive immune system (no antibodies), corals can develop resistance to pathogens. The Coral Probiotic Hypothesis may help explain the evolutionary success of corals and moderate the predictions of their demise.},

Here we examine the extent of spatial and temporal variation in thermal tolerance among scleractinian coral taxa and between locations during the 2010 thermally induced, large-scale bleaching event in South East Asia.
Surveys to estimate the bleaching and mortality indices of coral genera were carried out at three locations with contrasting thermal and bleaching histories. Despite the magnitude of thermal stress being similar among locations in 2010, there was a remarkable contrast in the patterns of bleaching susceptibility. Comparisons of bleaching susceptibility within coral taxa and among locations revealed no significant differences between locations with similar thermal histories, but significant differences between locations with contrasting thermal histories (Friedman = 34.97; p<0.001). Bleaching was much less severe at locations that bleached during 1998, that had greater historical temperature variability and lower rates of warming. Remarkably, Acropora and Pocillopora, taxa that are typically highly susceptible, although among the most susceptible in Pulau Weh (Sumatra, Indonesia) where respectively, 94% and 87% of colonies died, were among the least susceptible in Singapore, where only 5% and 12% of colonies died.
The pattern of susceptibility among coral genera documented here is unprecedented. A parsimonious explanation for these results is that coral populations that bleached during the last major warming event in 1998 have adapted and/or acclimatised to thermal stress. These data also lend support to the hypothesis that corals in regions subject to more variable temperature regimes are more resistant to thermal stress than those in less variable environments.},

abstract = {Human activities release tremendous amounts of nitrogenous compounds into the atmosphere. Wet and dry deposition distributes this airborne nitrogen (N) on otherwise pristine ecosystems. This eutrophication process significantly alters the species composition of native grasslands; generally a few nitrophilic plant species become dominant while many other species disappear. The functional equilibrium model predicts that, compared to species that decline in response to N enrichment, nitrophilic grass species should respond to N enrichment with greater biomass allocation aboveground and reduced allocation to roots and mycorrhizas. The mycorrhizal feedback hypothesis states that the composition of mycorrhizal fungal communities may influence the composition of plant communities, and it predicts that N enrichment may generate reciprocal shifts in the species composition of mycorrhizal fungi and plants. We tested these hypotheses with experiments that compared biomass allocation and mycorrhizal function of four grass ecotypes (three species), two that gained and two that lost biomass and cover in response to long-term N enrichment experiments at Cedar Creek and Konza Long-Term Ecological Research grasslands. Local grass ecotypes were grown in soil from their respective sites and inoculated with whole-soil inoculum collected from either fertilized (FERT) or unfertilized (UNFERT) plots. Our results strongly support the functional equilibrium model. In both grassland systems the nitrophilic grass species grew taller, allocated more biomass to shoots than to roots, and formed fewer mycorrhizas compared to the grass species that it replaced. Our results did not fully support the hypothesis that N-induced changes in the mycorrhizal fungal community were drivers of the plant community shifts that accompany N eutrophication. The FERT and UNFERT soil inoculum influenced the growth of the grasses differently, but this varied with site and grass ecotype in both expected and unexpected ways suggesting that ambient soil fertility or other factors may be interacting with mycorrhizal feedbacks.},

abstract = {Microbes are now well regarded for their important role in mammalian health. The microbiology of skin--a unique interface between the host and environment--is a major research focus in human health and skin disorders, but is less explored in other mammals. Here, we report on a cross-population study of the skin-associated bacterial community of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), and examine the potential for a core bacterial community and its variability with host (endogenous) or geographic/environmental (exogenous) specific factors. Skin biopsies or freshly sloughed skin from 56 individuals were sampled from populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and South Pacific oceans and bacteria were characterized using 454 pyrosequencing of SSU rRNA genes. Phylogenetic and statistical analyses revealed the ubiquity and abundance of bacteria belonging to the Flavobacteria genus Tenacibaculum and the Gammaproteobacteria genus Psychrobacter across the whale populations. Scanning electron microscopy of skin indicated that microbial cells colonize the skin surface. Despite the ubiquity of Tenacibaculum and Psychrobater spp., the relative composition of the skin-bacterial community differed significantly by geographic area as well as metabolic state of the animals (feeding versus starving during migration and breeding), suggesting that both exogenous and endogenous factors may play a role in influencing the skin-bacteria. Further, characteristics of the skin bacterial community from these free-swimming individuals were assembled and compared to two entangled and three dead individuals, revealing a decrease in the central or core bacterial community members (Tenacibaculum and Psychrobater spp.), as well as the emergence of potential pathogens in the latter cases. This is the first discovery of a cross-population, shared skin bacterial community. This research suggests that the skin bacteria may be connected to humpback health and immunity and could possibly serve as a useful index for health and skin disorder monitoring of threatened and endangered marine mammals.},

The same fungal species isolated from plants in habitats devoid of salt or heat stress did not confer these stress tolerances. Moreover, fungal endophytes from agricultural crops conferred disease resistance and not salt or heat tolerance. We define habitat-specific, symbiotically-conferred stress tolerance as habitat-adapted symbiosis and hypothesize that it is responsible for the establishment of plants in high-stress habitats. The agricultural, coastal and geothermal plant endophytes also colonized tomato (a model eudicot) and conferred disease, salt and heat tolerance, respectively. In addition, the coastal plant endophyte colonized rice (a model monocot) and conferred salt tolerance. These endophytes have a broad host range encompassing both monocots and eudicots. Interestingly, the endophytes also conferred drought tolerance to plants regardless of the habitat of origin. Abiotic stress tolerance correlated either with a decrease in water consumption or reactive oxygen sensitivity/generation but not to increased osmolyte production. The ability of fungal endophytes to confer stress tolerance to plants may provide a novel strategy for mitigating the impacts of global climate change on agricultural and native plant communities.},

Summary: Looked at symbiodinium diversity between the Caribbean and the GBR

Question:

Methods:
DGGE
ITS2

Results:
The GBR has fewer symbiodinium types than the Caribbean
C1 and C3 are present in both places, but the rest are regionally endemic
"The resilience of Porites spp and the resistance of Montipora digitala to thermal stress and bleaching are partially explained by their association with a thermally tolerant symbiont type, whereas the indiscriminate widespread bleaching and  death amon certain Pacific corals, during El nNino Southern Oscillation events, are influenced by associations with symbionts possessing higher sensitivity to thermal stress"
"In the Pacific, types C1, C3, and C21 occupy tissues from a wide range of host taxa at various depths and are vied as generalists. In contrast, specific symbionts have ecological distributions that are limited to specific host tissues, so these are viewed as specialists. 
"Specialization for a particular host environment and differences in thermal tolerance underscore the fact that, although sequence divergence between clade C symbionts is low, this lineage contains many species that are ecologically and physiologically distinct."
"Host diversity (habitat diversity) and abundance (habitat availability) may also be factors that influence Symbiodinium spa diversity and the relative proportion of generalists versus specialists.

Problems:
The long-term evolutionary conclusions seem like a stretch from comparisons between the number of observed clades in the Caribbean vs. GBR (also, van Oppen found other clades in the Pacific{\ldots})

Summary: Used genetic and in situ physiological analyses of symbio in to coral spp to explain their vertical distribution

Question: Does the presence of specific symbionts adapted to different light regimes determine the vertical distribution of particular hosts?

Methods:
Collection along depth range (0 to 14 m, n=10/species)
Fluorescence using PAM
small subunit ribosomal RNA, RFLP, DGGE, ITS2
Coral Transplants

Results:
Found that the two species had host-specific symbionts that are adapted to two different light climates{\ldots}which explains the vertical distribution of these 2 species
"These results reinforce the importance of niche diversification as a factor in the maintenance of coral reef diversity."'
"Contrary to the prevailing idea that most reef corals have flexible associations with their symbiont communities, and are capable of reshuffling symbionts in response to environmental changes, our data indicate that these two dominant coral species exhibit a high degree of symbiont specificity, independent of environmental conditions."
"This geographical mosaic in host-symbiont specificity demonstrates the capacity for a symbiont to be specialized for one particular host in one region, but display variations in specificity over wide geographical ranges."

Problems:

Impressions: 
I wonder if these coral species are generalists or specialists{\ldots}?},

Summary: "To use this large dataset (cladal identity of zooxanthellae in 442 coral species) to reach conclusions about coral-algal symbioses and the possibility and generality of symbiont turnover in times of global climate change."
AKA A strong opposition to the ABH and anyone who thinks that corals can switch their symbiodinium in the face of environmental stress.

Question:

Methods:
"Sample sizes for number of colonies sampled from a particular coral species ranged from 1 to 565 with only 18% represented by a sample size of 1."

Results:
"The current data demonstrate that, as adults, most coral species may not be able to change their zooxanthella population."
1) Most corals host a single zooxanthella clade (only 23% have been observed with {\&}gt;1)
2) Coral species that host a single zooxanthella clade do not demonstrate algal turnover even at the within-clade level
3) No study has demonstrated that coral species hosting a single zooxanthella clade form new symbiotic combinations with 'cryptic zooxanthellae'
4) Can early ontogeny provide a window to acquiring new zooxanthella genotypes in those coral species where the adults do not change zooxanthella genotypes?"

Problems:
"All documented instances of long-term change in symbiont populations, for example, have been reported from corals that naturally host multiple zooxanthella clades." Wellll{\ldots}.yeah? you would never see a change in symbiont populations without observing multiple clades.
"In summary, all studies on coral species that host a single zooxanthella clade show no algal turnover at the clade or sub-clade level." Also, duh? aka In corals where we only ever saw one type of symbiont, we never saw other types of symbionts{\ldots}?

Impressions: 
It would be nice if they had a histogram of the number of samples for each of the species they sampled. },

Fitt Brown Warner and Dunne (2001)
Coral Reefs 20:51-65

Summary: Review of the thermal tolerance in the context of organismal and biochemical responses occurring during coral bleaching, with emphasis on methods of detection and interpretation of animal and algal symbiont stress.

Things that make corals bleach:
decreased salinity
increased temperature
low temperature
exposure at low tide
sedimentation
darkness
solar radiation
What makes corals bleach? Higher temperatures, lower temperatures, being uncovered, being covered, being in the dark, being in the light (and also decreased salinity).

Three types of bleaching:
physiological bleaching
algal-stress bleaching
animal-stress bleaching

Results:
impossible to cite a single lethal temperature without specifying the exposure period

"factors leading to reduced `water clarity' achieve the same result as `physiological bleaching' and `algal-stress bleaching:' reduced photosynthesis, loss of animal biomass, and lower densities of symbiotic dinoflagellates. Therefore it would be difficult to look at a coral exhibiting decreased densities of zooxanthellae and host tissues and know how they got that way, unless other data are available (e.g. temperature records, depth of coral, time of day/year, and location collected,fluorescence and pigmentation data, history of local environ- mental perturbations, etc.)."
"The fine-scale spatial variability of coral bleaching responses to local conditions imposes a serious limitation on upscaling from individual colonies or species to entire reefs or reef provinces"

"It is not possible to measure only one parameter of a coral and relate it to one parameter of the environment (i.e. temperature) and draw any reliable conclusions as to causes or severity of stresses impinging on corals or coral reefs"
"It is possible, however, to measure a variety of environmental factors (e.g. temperature and duration, light intensity and wavelengths) and relate those to non-intrusive fluorometric measurements, as well as destructive sampling of biochemical and molecular marker from small samples of coral, in order to infer causes of coral stress and the fate of stressed corals. The interpretation of such measurements must take into account duel and seasonal fluxes as well as local environmental history"

"Additionally, it is necessary to specify not only exposure times, but also what irradiances were used in temperature experiments. Indeed, if experiments in the laboratory are to have any relevance to the natural world, multifactorial studies of responses to physical stressors are required where absolute temperature, irradiance, and exposure time are minimum variables."

Problems:

Impressions: **Good explanation of PAM**

"A thorough understanding of the organismal responsees occurring during bleachingg will help explain changes in coral populations and in the coral reef community, and perhaps assist in predicting the future of reef corals and coral reefs during the next century of global climate change},

One colony (HL) was naturally exposed to a high light environment and another nearby colony (LL) was exposed to 5.9 times lower light levels due to shadowing by a pier. For 10 days in August 1997, seawater temperatures in the surrounding reef lagoon rose up to 1.5 degrees C above the 6-year August average. The HL colony bleached to white during this period, whereas, the LL colony remained dark-brown colored. The HL colony recovered its normal dark-brown coloration (reversible bleaching) within several weeks, during which time the seawater temperatures returned to average. The following year, for 10 days, seawater temperatures rose up to 3 degrees C above the 7-year August average and both colonies bleached to white and neither colony recovered (irreversible bleaching). Both colonies were rapidly overgrown by algae and hydroids and, as of June 2003, no recovery has taken place. Prior to the 1997 bleaching, experiments using solar radiation showed that the quantum yield of photosystem II charge separation of branches from HL and LL colonies were affected for several hours by exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280 to 400 nm), but recovered by the same evening, suggesting that UVR does not have long-term effects on photochemistry in M. alcicornis. In situ effective quantum yield of photosystem II charge separation (deltaF/Fm') measurements before the 1998 bleaching event indicate that both colonies were healthy in terms of the physiological status of their endosymbionts. During and after the 1998 bleaching event, both colonies showed a reduction in deltaF/Fm' and consequently an increase in excitation pressure on photosystem II. The data suggest that temperature is not the only factor that causes bleaching and that solar radiation may play an important role in coral bleaching.},

abstract = {We present an experimental and numerical study of the effects of multiple scattering on the optical properties of reef-building corals. For this, we propose a simplified optical model of the coral and describe in some detail methods for characterizing the coral skeleton and the layer containing the symbiotic algae. The model is used to study the absorption of light by the layer of tissue containing the microalgae by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that, through scattering, the skeleton homogenizes and enhances the light environment in which the symbionts live. We also present results that illustrate the modification of the internal light environment when the corals loose symbionts or pigmentation.},

Interesting! But how do you operationalize this in the field?

And then they say that in the Pacific a management focus on state might be more appropriate where ecological resilience is consistently high. Also, state likely translates into ecosystem fcn and services better than resilience...but only if you know that your reef really is resilient (do we know that? If Pacific reefs were resilient, would the London site of Kiri be so shitty? Not sure.)},

abstract = {Rising sea temperatures cause mass coral bleaching and threaten reefs worldwide. We show how maps of variations in thermal stress can be used to help manage reefs for climate change. We map proxies of chronic and acute thermal stress and develop evidence-based hypotheses for the future response of corals to each stress regime. We then incorporate spatially realistic predictions of larval connectivity among reefs of the Bahamas and apply novel reserve design algorithms to create reserve networks for a changing climate. We show that scales of larval dispersal are large enough to connect reefs from desirable thermal stress regimes into a reserve network. Critically, we find that reserve designs differ according to the anticipated scope for phenotypic and genetic adaptation in corals, which remains uncertain. Attempts to provide a complete reserve design that hedged against different evolutionary outcomes achieved limited success, which emphasises the importance of considering the scope for adaptation explicitly. Nonetheless, 15% of reserve locations were selected under all evolutionary scenarios, making them a high priority for early designation. Our approach allows new insights into coral holobiont adaptation to be integrated directly into an adaptive approach to management.},

abstract = {Classifying the biological traits of organisms can test conceptual frameworks of life-history strategies and allow for predictions of how different species may respond to environmental disturbances. We apply a trait-based classification approach to a complex and threatened group of species, scleractinian corals. Using hierarchical clustering and random forests analyses, we identify up to four life-history strategies that appear globally consistent across 143 species of reef corals: competitive, weedy, stress-tolerant and generalist taxa, which are primarily separated by colony morphology, growth rate and reproductive mode. Documented shifts towards stress-tolerant, generalist and weedy species in coral reef communities are consistent with the expected responses of these life-history strategies. Our quantitative trait-based approach to classifying life-history strategies is objective, applicable to any taxa and a powerful tool that can be used to evaluate theories of community ecology and predict the impact of environmental and anthropogenic stressors on species assemblages.

This study explores the seasonal trend of zooxanthellae densities in the common coral, Acropora millepora over a period of seven months at a relatively undisturbed environment, the inshore reefs of the Palm Island Group in the Central Section of the Great Barrier Reef. Zooxanthellae densities increased twofold at both sites with the onset of colder temperatures and lower solar flux. This strongly suggests that a seasonal component is responsible for the observed changes in algal densities in A. millepora. Zooxanthellae densities also varied between colonies (F=4.858, p=0.000) and branches (F=1.565, p=0.001). The results of this study stress the importance of accounting for seasonal variation and for variation within and among colonies when designing studies to determine zooxanthellae densities and assessing the intensity of bleaching during mass bleaching events.},

abstract = {Antipatharians, commonly known as black corals, are treasured by many cultures for medicinal purposes and to produce jewellery. Despite their economic and cultural importance, very little is known about the basic biology and ecology of black corals because most species inhabit deeper-water environments (>50m) which are logistically challenging to study. There has been a recent increase of studies focusing on antipatharians; however, these have not yet been comprehensively reviewed. This literature review seeks to summarize the available information on the biology and ecology of antipatharians. Although black corals occur throughout all oceans and from subtidal to abyssal depths, they are particularly common in tropical and subtropical regions at depths below 50m. Antipatharians are generally found in areas with hard substrates, low-light and strong currents. Under favourable conditions, some black coral species form dense aggregations to the point of becoming ecologically dominant. Zooplankton appears to be the major component of the diet of black corals, which feed as suspension feeders and use mucus and nematocysts to capture their prey. Previously categorized as azooxanthellate corals, recent research has revealed that many antipatharians appear capable of harbouring symbionts, but unlike other corals, dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium are generally not important to the nutrition of black corals. Antipatharians reproduce through both sexual and asexual processes. In general, polyps and colonies are gonochoric, with fertilization and larval development likely occurring externally; however, to date antipatharian larvae have only been observed for a single species. Antipatharians are generally slow-growing and long-lived organisms with maximum longevities ranging from decades to millennia. Black corals are more abundant with depth, a pattern which has been hypothesized to avoid competition with obligate photosynthetic fauna. Additionally, antipatharians may compete for space by using sweeper tentacles and secondary metabolites. With the exception of a few predators such as gastropods and green sea turtles, antipatharians appear to be little impacted by predation. Like other corals, antipatharians can be habitat engineers of importance to a myriad of associated organisms including arthropods, annelids, echinoderms, mollusks, sponges and cnidarians, several of which are adapted to live exclusively on black corals. Given that most black coral species inhabit remote environments, our understanding of these organisms will depend on our ability to effectively sample and study them. Future collections, particularly in deeper waters (>50m), will be needed to determine whether antipatharian species have limited biogeographical distributions or whether this has simply been an artefact of low sampling efforts away from population centres and taxonomic uncertainties within this group. Additionally, biological and ecological studies require increased sample sizes because most information is currently derived from the examination of only a handful of specimens.

Summary: Developed a model of coral and symbiont ecological dynamics and symbiont evolutionary dynamics

Question: is climate change too rapid for an adequate coral community response? 

Methods:
Model
Ignore the evolutionary dynamics of corals (since "symbiont generation times are much shorter and their evolution may occur at a more rapid rate compared to corals.")
They "model the discrete, limited shifts in thermal tolerance potentially associated with shifts between symbiont strains with the presence of multiple symbiont types that differ in their thermal tolerance."

Results:
"Model results without variation in symbiont thermal tolerance predict coral reef collapse within decades under multiple future climate scenarios, consistent with previous threshold-based predictions. However, model results with genetic or community-level variation in symbiont thermal tolerance can predict coral reef persistence into the next century, provided low enough greenhouse gas emissions occur."
"symbiont diversity, on both the genetic and community levels, has the potential to allow coral reef persistence over some scenarios for the next 100 years of climate change." -{\&}gt; very interesting because it specifically mentions both genetic and community levels. So if/when we narrow down symbiodinium diversity to clades (by eliminating groupings based on the assumption of multiple ITS2 copies) would we be losing information on the genetic variability of the symbiodinium which might be driving the ability of coral reefs to persist?
***"Therefore, provided a conservation coal of protecting coral reefs more likely to be resistant and resilient to future climate change, empirically measuring symbiont genetic variation and community composition may be vital to identifying coral reefs to target for protect from additional anthropogenic impacts.***
"More generally, coral reefs are one of many systems that exist at the edge of their physiological limits and therefore face an immediate threat from climate change;"

abstract = {Given climate change, thermal stress-related mass coral-bleaching events present one of the greatest anthropogenic threats to coral reefs. While corals and their symbiotic algae may respond to future temperatures through genetic adaptation and shifts in community compositions, the climate may change too rapidly for coral response. To test this potential for response, here we develop a model of coral and symbiont ecological dynamics and symbiont evolutionary dynamics. Model results without variation in symbiont thermal tolerance predict coral reef collapse within decades under multiple future climate scenarios, consistent with previous threshold-based predictions. However, model results with genetic or community-level variation in symbiont thermal tolerance can predict coral reef persistence into the next century, provided low enough greenhouse gas emissions occur. Therefore, the level of greenhouse gas emissions will have a significant effect on the future of coral reefs, and accounting for biodiversity and biological dynamics is vital to estimating the size of this effect.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching, i.e., loss of most of the symbiotic zooxanthellae normally found within coral tissue, has occurred with increasing frequency on coral reefs throughout the world in the last 20 years, mostly during periods of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Experiments and observations indicate that coral bleaching results primarily from elevated seawater temperatures under high light conditions, which increases rates of biochemical reactions associated with zooxanthellar photosynthesis, producing toxic forms of oxygen that interfere with cellular processes. Published projections of a baseline of increasing ocean temperature resulting from global warming have suggested that annual temperature maxima within 30 years may be at levels that will cause frequent coral bleaching and widespread mortality leading to decline of corals as dominant organisms on reefs. However, these projections have not considered the high variability in bleaching response that occurs among corals both within and among species. There is information that corals and their symbionts may be capable of acclimatization and selective adaptation to elevated temperatures that have already resulted in bleaching resistant coral populations, both locally and regionally, in various areas of the world. There are possible mechanisms that might provide resistance and protection to increased temperature and light. These include inducible heat shock proteins that act in refolding denatured cellular and structural proteins, production of oxidative enzymes that inactivate harmful oxygen radicals, fluorescent coral pigments that both reflect and dissipate light energy, and phenotypic adaptations of zooxanthellae and adaptive shifts in their populations at higher temperatures. Such mechanisms, when considered in conjunction with experimental and observational evidence for coral recovery in areas that have undergone coral bleaching, suggest an as yet undefined capacity in corals and zooxanthellae to adapt to conditions that have induced coral bleaching. Clearly, there are limits to acclimatory processes that can counter coral bleaching resulting from elevated sea temperatures, but scientific models will not accurately predict the fate of reef corals until we have a better understanding of coral-algal acclimatization/adaptation potential. Research is particularly needed with respect to the molecular and physiological mechanisms that promote thermal tolerance in corals and zooxanthellae and identification of genetic characteristics responsible for the variety of responses that occur in a coral bleaching event. Only then will we have some idea of the nature of likely responses, the timescales involved and the role of 'experience' in modifying bleaching impact.},

Compared to their shallow-water counterparts, these mesophotic coral reefs (30-150 m) are understudied, which has slowed our broader understanding of the biodiversity, ecology, and connectivity of shallow and deep coral reef communities. We know that the light environment is an important component of the productivity, physiology, and ecology of corals, and it restricts the distribution of most species of coral to depths of 60 m or less. In the Bahamas, the coral Montastraea cavernosa has a wide depth distribution, and it is one of the most numerous corals at mesophotic depths. Using a range of optical, physiological, and biochemical approaches, the relative dependence on autotrophy vs. heterotrophy was assessed for this coral from 3 to 91 m. These measurements show that the quantum yield of PSII fluorescence increases significantly with depth for M. cavernosa while gross primary productivity decreases with depth. Both morphological and physiological photoacclimatization occurs to a depth of 91 m, and stable isotope data of the host tissues, symbionts, and skeleton reveal a marked decrease in productivity and a sharp transition to heterotrophy between 45 and 61 m. Below these depths, significant changes in the genetic composition of the zooxanthellae community, including genotypes not previously observed, occur and suggest that there is strong selection for zooxanthellae that are suited for survival in the light-limited environment where mesophotic M. cavernosa are occurring.},

A complementary focus is now emerging on the Hsps of both model and nonmodel organisms undergoing stress in nature, on the roles of Hsps in the stress physiology of whole multicellular eukaryotes and the tissues and organs they comprise, and on the ecological and evolutionary correlates of variation in Hsps and the genes that encode them. This focus discloses that (a) expression of Hsps can occur in nature, (b) all species have hsp genes but they vary in the patterns of their expression, (c) Hsp expression can be correlated with resistance to stress, and (d) species' thresholds for Hsp expression are correlated with levels of stress that they naturally undergo. These conclusions are now well established and may require little additional confirmation; many significant questions remain unanswered concerning both the mechanisms of Hsp-mediated stress tolerance at the organismal level and the evolutionary mechanisms that have diversified the hsp genes.},

PLoS ONE 4(7):e6364

Summary: Outplanting experiment of Acropora millepora with several different symbiont types to see the relative contributions of host population (thermal history) and symbiont type

Question: Does Symbiodinium type or host type affect growth, survival and heat tolerance more?

Methods:
Field collected Acropora millepora offspring from two thermally contrasting locations
Experimentally infected with 1 of 6 symbiodinium types (spanning A, C, D)
Outplanted to two parental field locations
Response: growth, survival
PAM Fv/Fm

Results:
"1) Symbiodinium type was the most important predictor of holobiont fitness, as measured by growth, survival, and thermo-tolerance;
2) growth and survival, but not heat-tolerance, were also affected by local environmental conditions
3) Host population had little to no effect on holobiont fitness."

Number 3 suggests that it isn't the host's heat response that drives thermal tolerance, but the symbiont's response.

"Acclimatization is often reversible, but in some cases it may become fixed early in ontogeny, which is referred to as developmental plasticity or irreversible non-genetic adaptation. Developmental plasticity in thermo-tolerance has been found in organisms such as Drosophila sp and zebrafish, but our study is the first to assess developmental plasticity in a coral species, which has the added complexity of be

"Our results suggest that the potential for symbiont shuffling to increase holobiont fitness may be dependent on the environment."

abstract = {Calcium carbonate skeletons of scleractinian corals amplify light availability to their algal symbionts by diffuse scattering, optimizing photosynthetic energy acquisition. However, the mechanism of scattering and its role in coral evolution and dissolution of algal symbioses during "bleaching" events are largely unknown. Here we show that differences in skeletal fractal architecture at nano/micro-lengthscales within 96 coral taxa result in an 8-fold variation in light-scattering and considerably alter the algal light environment. We identified a continuum of properties that fall between two extremes: (1) corals with low skeletal fractality that are efficient at transporting and redistributing light throughout the colony with low scatter but are at higher risk of bleaching and (2) corals with high skeletal fractality that are inefficient at transporting and redistributing light with high scatter and are at lower risk of bleaching. While levels of excess light derived from the coral skeleton is similar in both groups, the low-scatter corals have a higher rate of light-amplification increase when symbiont concentration is reduced during bleaching, thus creating a positive feedback-loop between symbiont concentration and light-amplification that exposes the remaining symbionts to increasingly higher light intensities. By placing our findings in an evolutionary framework, in conjunction with a novel empirical index of coral bleaching susceptibility, we find significant correlations between bleaching susceptibility and light-scattering despite rich homoplasy in both characters; suggesting that the cost of enhancing light-amplification to the algae is revealed in decreased resilience of the partnership to stress.},

Previously, detrimental effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on coral health could not be ascertained until significant physiological responses resulted in visible signs of stress (e.g. tissue necrosis, bleaching). In this study, a focused anthozoan holobiont microarray was used to detect early and sub-lethal effects of spatial and temporal environmental changes on gene expression patterns in the scleractinian coral, Montastraea cavernosa, on south Florida reefs. Although all colonies appeared healthy (i.e. no visible tissue necrosis or bleaching), corals were differentially physiologically compensating for exposure to stressors that varied over time. Corals near the Port of Miami inlet experienced significant changes in expression of stress responsive and symbiont (zooxanthella)-specific genes after periods of heavy precipitation. In contrast, coral populations did not demonstrate stress responses during periods of increased water temperature (up to 29$\,^{\circ}$C). Specific acute and long-term localized responses to other stressors were also evident. A correlation between stress response genes and symbiont-specific genes was also observed, possibly indicating early processes involved in the maintenance or disruption of the coral-zooxanthella symbiosis. This is the first study to reveal spatially- and temporally-related variation in gene expression in response to different stressors of in situ coral populations, and demonstrates that microarray technology can be used to detect specific sub-lethal physiological responses to specific environmental conditions that are not visually detectable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The algal endosymbionts (genus Symbiodinium) associated with scleractinian corals (and other reef invertebrates) have received a lot of research attention in the past decade, particularly as certain host-symbiont associations appear more affected by increasing seawater temperatures than others. With the rapid accumulation of information on the diversity of Symbiodinium, it is becoming increasingly difficult to compare newly acquired Symbiodinium data with existing data to detect patterns of host-symbiont specificity on broader spatial scales. The lack of a general consensus on the classification of Symbiodinium species coupled with the variety of different markers used to identify the genus Symbiodinium (ITS1, ITS2, LSU D1/D2, chloroplast 23S rDNA and psbA minicircle) further complicate direct comparison.

DESCRIPTION:The SymbioGBR database compiles all currently available Symbiodinium sequences and associated host information of data collected from the Great Barrier Reef into a single relational database that is accessible via a user-friendly, searchable web-based application (http://www.SymbioGBR.org). SymbioGBR allows users to query Symbiodinium types or sequences sourced from various genetic markers (e.g. ITS1, ITS2, LSU D1/D2 and chloroplast 23S) and invertebrate host species to explore their reported associations. In addition, as the database includes sequence information of multiple genetic markers, it allows cross-referencing between conventional (e.g. ITS2 region) and novel markers that exhibit low intragenomic variability (e.g. psbA region). Finally, the database is based on the collection details of individual specimens. Such host-symbiont associations can be assessed quantitatively and viewed in relation to their environmental and geographic context.

CONCLUSIONS:The SymbioGBR database provides a comprehensive overview of Symbiodinium diversity and host-associations on the Great Barrier Reef. It provides a quick, user-friendly means to compare newly acquired data on Symbiodinium (e.g. raw sequences or characterized Symbiodinium types) with previous data on the diversity of invertebrate host-symbiont associations on the GBR. The inclusion of psbAncr sequence information allows for validation of widely used ITS1/ITS2 markers and their ability to accurately identify relevant sequences. Most importantly, centralization of sequence information from multiple genetic markers will aid the classification of Symbiodinium species diversity and allow researchers to easily compare patterns of host-Symbiodinium associations.},

Summary: 

Question: How do the effects of irradiance, UV radiation, and temperature affect the activities of enzymes providing protection against oxygen toxicity in both the host and zooxanthellae, and the concentrations of UV absorbing compounds, and on the loss of zooxanthellae in a zoanthid?

Methods:

Results:
Increasing temperature significantly reduces the total number of zooxanthellae per polyp
"At the same time temperature, irradiance (photosynthetically active radiation = PAR), and ul- traviolet radiation (UV) independently increase the activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase within the zooxanthellae of the zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum."
"Increases in temperature or highly ener- getic UV radiation can increase the flux of active forms of oxygen, particularly at the elevated oxygen concentra- tions that prevail in the tissues during photosynthesis, with oxygen toxicity potentially mediating the bleaching event."
"the concentration of UV absorbing compounds within the symbiosis is inversely related to temperature, potentially increasing exposure of the host and zooxanthellae to the direct effects of UV."

Problems: They didn't actually measure how much active oxygen was present

Several studies have suggested that increases in the abundance of thermally tolerant endosymbionts may ameliorate the effect of climate change on reefs. Symbionts that confer tolerance to temperature also reduce the growth rate of their coral host. Here, we show, using a spatial ecosystem model, that an increment in the abundance of a thermally tolerant endosymbiont (D1a) is unlikely to ensure the persistence of Caribbean reefs, or to reduce their rate of decline, due to the concomitant reduction in growth rate under current thermal stress predictive scenarios. Furthermore, our results suggest that given the documented vital rates of D1a-dominated corals, increasing dominance of D1a in coral hosts may have a detrimental effect by reducing the resilience of Caribbean reefs, and preventing their long-term recovery. This is because Caribbean ecosystems appear to be highly sensitive to changes in the somatic growth rate of corals. Alternative outcomes might be expected in systems with different community-level dynamics such as reefs in the Indo-Pacific, where the ecological costs of reduced growth rate might be far smaller.},

abstract = {Growth anomaly (GA) is a commonly observed coral disease that impairs biological functions of the affected tissue. GA is prevalent at Wai '{\=o}pae tide pools, southeast Hawai 'i Island. Here two distinct forms of this disease, Type A and Type B, affect the coral, Montiporacapitata. While the effects of GA on biology and ecology of the coral host are beginning to be understood, the impact of this disease on the photophysiology of the dinoflagellate symbiont, Symbiodinium spp., has not been investigated. The GA clearly alters coral tissue structure and skeletal morphology and density. These tissue and skeletal changes are likely to modify not only the light micro-environment of the coral tissue, which has a direct impact on the photosynthetic potential of Symbiodinium spp., but also the physiological interactions within the symbiosis. This study utilized Pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry (PAM) to characterize the photophysiology of healthy and GA-affected M. capitata tissue. Overall, endosymbionts within GA-affected tissue exhibit reduced photochemical efficiency. Values of both Fv/Fm and $\Delta$F/ Fm' were significantly lower (p<0.01) in GA tissue compared to healthy and unaffected tissues. Tracking the photophysiology of symbionts over a diurnal time period enabled a comparison of symbiont responses to photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) among tissue conditions. Symbionts within GA tissue exhibited the lowest values of $\Delta$F/Fm' as well as the highest pressure over photosystem II (p<0.01). This study provides evidence that the symbionts within GA-affected tissue are photochemically compromised compared to those residing in healthy tissue.},

Summary: 

Question: Are coral-dinoflagellate symbioses driven by host-symbiont recombination or natural selection?

Methods:
Extreme COLD water event in winter 2008 in Gulf of California
Symbiodinium community composition

Results:
Cold water bleached C1b-c but did not bleach colonies with D1
During recovery B1 was found on branch tips, but was replaced within a few months.
"The differential loss of Pocillopora holobionts in response to thermal stress suggests that natural selection on existing variation can cause rapid and significant shifts in the frequency of particular coral-algal partnerships.
"While novel combinations may be induced experimentally, there is little evidence that such processes readily occur naturally and/or are permanent."
"The severity and geographic scope of a single disturbance, or frequency of repeated disturbances, will likely dictate the extent to which differential survival changes the community composition of coral-algal symbioses. However, if conditions continue to worsen as projected, substantial coral mortality will ultimately threaten the functional integrity of these ecosystems.

Problems:
Imply that shuffling cannot occur, but then they saw it in 5 colonies. Then assume that it's low rate of incidence means that symbiont "shuffling" did not contribute to substantive shifts in the relative frequency of D1 in the Gulf of California (Seems like a pretty big jump to me!)

Summary: Description of how the symbioses of major reef-building species in the Caribbean respond to severe thermal stress before, during and after a severe bleaching event.

Question: When does the change in symbionts occur during bleaching events?

Methods:
ITS DGGE fingerprinting
realtime PCR

Results:
Found that Symbiodinium increased in the weeks leading up to and during the bleaching episode, and disproportionately dominated colonies that did not bleach.
"However, competitive displacement by homologous symbionts significantly reduced S. trenchi's prevalence and dominance among colonies after a 2-year period following the bleaching event."

Summary: Investigated Symbiodinium diversity along a large geographic region (along the coast of Australia)

Question: How do latitudinal gradients affect Symbiodinium diversity?
"Changes in symbiont diversity have not been examined consistently within a single host or among multiple species over widely different latitudes"

Methods:
RFLP of partial 18S ribosomal DNA + sequence analysis of partial 28S rDNA

Results:
"P. versipora associates with at least two distinct genotypes of symbiotic dinoflagellatees and that the presence of these genotypes varies with latitude."
Subtropical/Tropical = clade C, High latitude = clade B
"The geographicaly distinct varieties of symbionts within the tissue of this hermatypic coral are likely to be associated with algal physiological differences, which in turn may relate to changing selective pressures{\ldots}"
Found a high degree of host fidelity - claim because within-clade variation is less than 1% while among-clade divergence was {\&}gt;10%
"The maternal transfer of clonal symbionts to the daughter colonies and the low dispersal range of this species, for example, are factors that would act to increase the likelihood that symbionts in populations of corals would be most similar with a population on a local scale."
Clade B has a wider latitudinal gradient than clade C

Problems: "This paper provides indirect evidence that selection on a coral-dinoflagellate association may have led to one symbiont type being exchanged for another. Clade B Symbiodinium spa might specialize in the lower light and cooler conditions of higher latitude environments" This is an interesting idea, but I'm not entirely sure that it is supported by concrete evidence. I see the correlation, but not necessarily the causation.

"It is also possible that these cryptic Sybmiodinium are types that have overcome the initial steps of being accepted as an intracellular symbiont, but await further evolutionary steps to become a prominent endosymbiont"
"Within clade C, the generalists have a global distribution and appear to be 'living ancestors' from which evolution of all other clade C types has occurred."
**"Corals present in reefs in the Caribbean predominantly harbour clades A-C, whereas corals in the Pacific mainly contain clade C symbionts, indicating a higher diversity of symbionts in the Caribbean compared to the Pacific. Interestingly this reveals an inverse relationship between host diversity and symbiont diversity, as the Pacific contains a richer diversity of hosts."
""{\ldots}An examination of host and symbiont phylogenies based on molecular analysis reveals specificity at the family level{\ldots}in this case, some types of symbiotinium only associate with Poritidae. However, there are other cases where a Symbiodinium type associates with a broader array of coral families." (From the symbiodinium's perspective)
"Most infectivity studies show that hosts consistently accept their homologous algae, reject others, and when accepting heterologous symbiont types, display reduced fitness and growth."
"{\ldots}even though initial infection appears non-specific in some hosts and competition of different types and subsequent abundance in the host environment can vary, recognition and uptake of a specific symbiont occurs during the onset of symbiosis, which ultimately determines which symbiont will establish itself as the dominant type."
"Reciprocal diversification is driven by coevolution, and may explain the high number of specialist symbionts in hosts with a maternal transmission strategy."
Diagram of symbiont switching and shifting
"Cryptic types may still be present in these host species, but may have lost or have not yet evolved, the ability to become a dominant symbiont type over extended periods of time."
**"This emphasizes the point that clades are a diverse group of organisms and should not be collectively grouped according to physiology."

Summary: Analysis of heritability, estimate the proportion of the variance in thermal tolerance treats that have a genetic basis as a proxy for their adaptive potential in A. millepora

Question:

Methods:
PAM
HPLC

Results:
Significant heritability's for traits - photosynthesis, photo protective pigments
Lack of heritability in expression of fundamental stress genes
Heritable - coral colony growth (contributed to by both symbiotic partners)
High heritability - functional key traits of algal symbionts allow for rapid thermal adaptation

"The major finding of our study is that coral-associated symbionts, which are generally considered to initiate the coral bleaching response possess a substantially higher potential for thermal-stress adaptation than their coral animal host. This appears to put A. millepora into a half-full glass situation, in which the adaptive potential to climate warming is largely determined by the algal partner of the symbiosis."

abstract = {The persistence of tropical coral reefs is threatened by rapidly increasing climate warming, causing a functional breakdown of the obligate symbiosis between corals and their algal photosymbionts (Symbiodinium) through a process known as coral bleaching. Yet the potential of the coral-algal symbiosis to genetically adapt in an evolutionary sense to warming oceans is unknown. Using a quantitative genetics approach, we estimated the proportion of the variance in thermal tolerance traits that has a genetic basis (i.e. heritability) as a proxy for their adaptive potential in the widespread Indo-Pacific reef-building coral Acropora millepora. We chose two physiologically different populations that associate respectively with one thermo-tolerant (Symbiodinium clade D) and one less tolerant symbiont type (Symbiodinium C2). In both symbiont types, pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed significant heritabilities for traits related to both photosynthesis and photoprotective pigment profile. However, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays showed a lack of heritability in both coral host populations for their own expression of fundamental stress genes. Coral colony growth, contributed to by both symbiotic partners, displayed heritability. High heritabilities for functional key traits of algal symbionts, along with their short clonal generation time and high population sizes allow for their rapid thermal adaptation. However, the low overall heritability of coral host traits, along with the corals' long generation time, raise concern about the timely adaptation of the coral-algal symbiosis in the face of continued rapid climate warming.},

abstract = {In Hawaii, coral reefs occur across a gradient of biological (host abundance), climatic (sea surface temperature anomalies) and anthropogenic conditions from the human-impacted reefs of the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) to the pristine reefs of the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). Coral disease surveys were conducted at 142 sites from across the Archipelago and disease patterns examined. Twelve diseases were recorded from three coral genera (Porites, Montipora, Acropora) with Porites having the highest prevalence. Porites growth anomalies (PorGAs) were significantly more prevalent within and indicative of reefs in the MHI and Porites trematodiasis (PorTrm) was significantly more prevalent within and indicative of reefs in the NWHI. Porites tissue loss syndrome (PorTLS) was also important in driving regional differences but that relationship was less clear. These results highlight the importance of understanding disease ecology when interpreting patterns of disease occurrence. PorTrm is caused by a parasitic flatworm that utilizes multiple hosts during its life cycle (fish, mollusk and coral). All three hosts must be present for the disease to occur and higher host abundance leads to higher disease prevalence. Thus, a high prevalence of PorTrm on Hawaiian reefs would be an indicator of a healthy coral reef ecosystem. In contrast, the high occurrence of PorGAs within the MHI suggests that PorGAs are related, directly or indirectly, to some environmental co-factor associated with increased human population sizes. Focusing on the three indicator diseases (PorGAs, PorTrm, PorTLS) we used statistical modeling to examine the underlying associations between disease prevalence and 14 different predictor variables (biotic and abiotic). All three diseases showed positive associations with host abundance and negative associations with thermal stress. The association with human population density differed among disease states with PorGAs showing a positive and PorTrm showing a negative association, but no significant explanatory power was offered for PorTLS.},

abstract = {A mild bleaching event (9.2% prevalence) at Palmyra Atoll occurred in response to the 2009 ENSO, when mean water temperature reached 29.8-30.1 degrees C. Prevalence among both abundant and sparse taxa varied with no clear pattern in susceptibility relating to coral morphology. Seven taxon-specific models showed that turbidity exacerbated while prior exposure to higher background temperatures alleviated bleaching, with these predictors explaining an average 16.3% and 11.5% variation in prevalence patterns, respectively. Positive associations occurred between bleaching prevalence and both immediate temperature during the bleaching event (average 8.4% variation explained) and increased sand cover (average 3.7%). Despite these associations, mean unexplained variation in prevalence equalled 59%. Lower bleaching prevalence in areas experiencing higher background temperatures suggests acclimation to temperature stress among several coral genera, while WWII modifications may still be impacting the reefs via shoreline sediment re-distribution and increased turbidity, exacerbating coral bleaching susceptibility during periods of high temperature stress.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 yr much has been learned about a unique symbiotic interaction between fungal endophytes and grasses. The fungi (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) grow intercellularly and systemically in aboveground plant parts. Vertically transmitted asexual endophytes forming asymptomatic infections of cool-season grasses have been repeatedly derived from sexual species that abort host inflorescences. The phylogenetic distribution of seed-transmitted endophytes is strongly suggestive of cocladogenesis with their hosts. Molecular evidence indicates that many seed-transmitted endophytes are interspecific hybrids. Superinfection may result in hyphal fusion and parasexual recombination. Most endophytes produce one or more alkaloid classes that likely play some role in defending the host plant against pests. Hybridization may have led to the proliferation of alkaloid-production genes among asexual endophytes, favoring hybrids. The ergot alkaloid ergovaline, lolitrems, and lolines are produced by only a single sexual species, Epichlo{\"e} festucae, but they are common in seed-transmitted endophytes, suggesting that E. festucae contributed genes for their synthesis. Asexual hybrids may also be favored by the counteracting of the accumulation of deleterious mutations (Muller's rachet). Endophyte infection can provide other benefits, such as enhanced drought tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and growth. Estimates of infection frequency have revealed variable levels of infection with especially high prevalence in the subfamily Pooideae. Longitudinal studies suggest that the prevalence of seed-transmitted endophytes can increase rapidly over time. In field experiments, infected tall fescue suppressed other grasses and forbs relative to uninfected fescue and supported lower consumer populations. Unlike other widespread plant/microbial symbioses based on the acquisition of mineral resources, grass/endophyte associations are based primarily on protection of the host from biotic and abiotic stresses.},

We present quantitative estimates of beta-diversity for tropical trees by comparing species composition of plots in lowland terra firme forest in Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. We compare observations with predictions derived from a neutral model in which habitat is uniform and only dispersal and speciation influence species turnover. We find that beta-diversity is higher in Panama than in western Amazonia and that patterns in both areas are inconsistent with the neutral model. In Panama, habitat variation appears to increase species turnover relative to Amazonia, where unexpectedly low turnover over great distances suggests that population densities of some species are bounded by as yet unidentified processes. At intermediate scales in both regions, observations can be matched by theory, suggesting that dispersal limitation, with speciation, influences species turnover.},

abstract = {As microbial ecologists take advantage of high-throughput sequencing technologies to describe microbial communities across ever-increasing numbers of samples, new analysis tools are required to relate the distribution of microbes among larger numbers of communities, and to use increasingly rich and standards-compliant metadata to understand the biological factors driving these relationships. In particular, the Earth Microbiome Project drives these needs by profiling the genomic content of tens of thousands of samples across multiple environment types.
Features of EMPeror include: ability to visualize gradients and categorical data, visualize different principal coordinates axes, present the data in the form of parallel coordinates, show taxa as well as environmental samples, dynamically adjust the size and transparency of the spheres representing the communities on a per-category basis, dynamically scale the axes according to the fraction of variance each explains, show, hide or recolor points according to arbitrary metadata including that compliant with the MIxS family of standards developed by the Genomic Standards Consortium, display jackknifed-resampled data to assess statistical confidence in clustering, perform coordinate comparisons (useful for procrustes analysis plots), and greatly reduce loading times and overall memory footprint compared with existing approaches. Additionally, ease of sharing, given EMPeror's small output file size, enables agile collaboration by allowing users to embed these visualizations via emails or web pages without the need for extra plugins.
Here we present EMPeror, an open source and web browser enabled tool with a versatile command line interface that allows researchers to perform rapid exploratory investigations of 3D visualizations of microbial community data, such as the widely used principal coordinates plots. EMPeror includes a rich set of controllers to modify features as a function of the metadata. By being specifically tailored to the requirements of microbial ecologists, EMPeror thus increases the speed with which insight can be gained from large microbiome datasets.},

Muller, Kooijman, Edmunds, Doyle, Nisbet 2009
J Theor Biol 259:44-57

Summary: Develop a dynamic energy budget model to describe the syntrophic symbiotic relationship between a heterotrophic host and an internal photoautotrophic symbiont.
This focuses on coral-Symbiodinium, but has fundamental application to other symbioses such as chemoautotrophic symbionts

Question:  To elucidate regulatory mechanisms for syntrophic symbiosis under a range of environmental conditions

Methods:
Model including host dynamics, symbiont dynamics and their interaction

Results:
Two regulation methods ( that the symbiont shares only photosynthate that it cannot use itself, and that the host delivers only excess nutrients to the symbiont) "suffice to obtain a stable symbiotic relationship under constant ambient conditions, provided those conditions support sustenance of host and symbiont."
Symbio density varies little as a fcn of ambient food density, inorganic nitrogen and irradience

Problems:

abstract = {In this paper we develop and investigate a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model describing the syntrophic symbiotic relationship between a heterotrophic host and an internal photoautotrophic symbiont. The model specifies the flows of matter and energy among host, symbiont and environment with minimal complexity and uses the concept of synthesizing units to describe smoothly the assimilation of multiple limiting factors, in particular inorganic carbon and nitrogen, and irradiance. The model has two passive regulation mechanisms: the symbiont shares only photosynthate that it cannot use itself, and the host delivers only excess nutrients to the symbiont. With parameter values plausible for scleractinian corals, we show that these two regulation mechanisms suffice to obtain a stable symbiotic relationship under constant ambient conditions, provided those conditions support sustenance of host and symbiont. Furthermore, the symbiont density in the host varies relatively little as a function of ambient food density, inorganic nitrogen and irradiance. This symbiont density tends to increase with light deprivation or nitrogen enrichment, either directly or via food. We also investigate the relative benefit each partner derives from the relationship and conclude that this relationship may shift from mutualism to parasitism as environmental conditions change.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellates are unicellular algae that are ubiquitously abundant in aquatic environments. Species of the genus Symbiodinium form symbiotic relationships with reef-building corals and other marine invertebrates. Despite their ecologic importance, little is known about the genetics of dinoflagellates in general and Symbiodinium in particular. Here, we used 454 sequencing to generate transcriptome data from two Symbiodinium species from different clades (clade A and clade B). With more than 56,000 assembled sequences per species, these data represent the largest transcriptomic resource for dinoflagellates to date. Our results corroborate previous observations that dinoflagellates possess the complete nucleosome machinery. We found a complete set of core histones as well as several H3 variants and H2A.Z in one species. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis points toward a low number of transcription factors in Symbiodinium spp. that also differ in the distribution of DNA-binding domains relative to other eukaryotes. In particular the cold shock domain was predominant among transcription factors. Additionally, we found a high number of antioxidative genes in comparison to non-symbiotic but evolutionary related organisms. These findings might be of relevance in the context of the role that Symbiodinium spp. play as coral symbionts.Our data represent the most comprehensive dinoflagellate EST data set to date. This study provides a comprehensive resource to further analyze the genetic makeup, metabolic capacities, and gene repertoire of Symbiodinium and dinoflagellates. Overall, our findings indicate that Symbiodinium possesses some unique characteristics, in particular the transcriptional regulation in Symbiodinium may differ from the currently known mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation.},

Summary: Summarized MAA production for a variety of species

Question: Is the relationship of MAAs to clad identity in field collected organisms consistent with that found in laboratory cultures?

Methods:
Test for MAA
ITS2

Results:
MAA were ubiquitous (at least one MAA was present in every sample of host tissue and the symbiotic dinos inside)
All had 1 - 4 different MAAs
**Main Result - before only clade A were observed to produce MAAs, while other clades did not. They found that under natural conditions this relationship does not hold.

abstract = {A survey of 54 species of symbiotic cnidarians that included hydrozoan corals, anemones, gorgonians and scleractinian corals was conducted in the Mexican Caribbean for the presence of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) in the host as well as the Symbiodinium fractions. The host fractions contained relatively simple MAA profiles, all harbouring between one and three MAAs, principally mycosporine-glycine followed by shinorine and porphyra-334 in smaller amounts. Symbiodinium populations were identified to sub-generic levels using PCR-DGGE analysis of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) region. Regardless of clade identity, all Symbiodinium extracts contained MAAs, in contrast to the pattern that has been found in cultures of Symbiodinium, where clade A symbionts produced MAAs whereas clade B, C, D, and E symbionts did not. Under natural conditions between one and four MAAs were identified in the symbiont fractions, mycosporine-glycine (@l"m"a"x=310 nm), shinorine (@l"m"a"x=334 nm), porphyra-334 (@l"m"a"x=334 nm) and palythine (@l"m"a"x=320 nm). One sample also contained mycosporine-2-glycine (@l"m"a"x=331 nm). These data suggest that Symbiodinium is restricted to producing five MAAs and there also appears to be a defined order of appearance of these MAAs: mycosporine-glycine followed by shinorine (in one case mycosporine-2-glycine), then porphyra-334 and palythine. Overall, mycosporine-glycine was found in highest concentrations in the host and symbiont extracts. This MAA, unlike many other MAAs, absorbs within the ultraviolet-B range (UVB, 280-320 nm) and is also known for moderate antioxidant properties thus potentially providing protection against the direct and indirect effects of UVR. No depth-dependent changes could be identified due to a high variability of MAA concentrations when all species were included in the analysis. The presence of at least one MAA in all symbiont and host fractions analyzed serves to highlight the importance of MAAs, and in particular the role of mycosporine-glycine, as photoprotectants in the coral reef environment.},

Histopathological investigation showed a loss of symbiont and melanin-containing granular cells which was more pronounced in the coenenchyme than the polyps. Cell counts confirmed a 65% reduction in symbiont density. Tissue loss was due to tissue fragmentation and necrosis in affected areas. In addition, a reduction in putative bacterial aggregate densities was found in diseased samples but no potential pathogens were observed.},

abstract = {Mutualistic symbioses between scleractinian corals and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) are the foundation of coral reef ecosystems. For many coral-algal symbioses, prolonged episodes of thermal stress damage the symbiont's photosynthetic capability, resulting in its expulsion from the host. Despite the link between photosynthetic competency and symbiont expulsion, little is known about the effect of thermal stress on the expression of photosystem genes in Symbiodinium. This study used real-time PCR to monitor the transcript abundance of two important photosynthetic reaction center genes, psbA (encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II) and psaA (encoding the P(700) protein of photosystem I), in four cultured isolates (representing ITS2-types A13, A20, B1, and F2) and two in hospite Symbiodinium spp. within the coral Pocillopora spp. (ITS2-types C1b-c and D1). Both cultured and in hospite Symbiodinium samples were exposed to elevated temperatures (32$\,^{\circ}$C) over a 7-day period and examined for changes in photochemistry and transcript abundance. Symbiodinium A13 and C1b-c (both thermally sensitive) demonstrated significant declines in both psbA and psaA during the thermal stress treatment, whereas the transcript levels of the other Symbiodinium types remained stable. The downregulation of both core photosystem genes could be the result of several different physiological mechanisms, but may ultimately limit repair rates of photosynthetic proteins, rendering some Symbiodinium spp. especially susceptible to thermal stress.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Divergent natural selection across environmental gradients has been acknowledged as a major driver of population and species divergence, however its role in the diversification of scleractinian corals remains poorly understood. Recently, it was demonstrated that the brooding coral Seriatopora hystrix and its algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium) are genetically partitioned across reef environments (0-30 m) on the far northern Great Barrier Reef. Here, we explore the potential mechanisms underlying this differentiation and assess the stability of host-symbiont associations through a reciprocal transplantation experiment across habitats ('Back Reef', 'Upper Slope' and 'Deep Slope'), in combination with molecular (mtDNA and ITS2-DGGE) and photo-physiological analyses (respirometry and HPLC).

RESULTS:The highest survival rates were observed for native transplants (measured 14 months after transplantation), indicating differential selective pressures between habitats. Host-symbiont assemblages remained stable during the experimental duration, demonstrating that the ability to "shuffle" or "switch" symbionts is restricted in S. hystrix. Photo-physiological differences were observed between transplants originating from the shallow and deep habitats, with indirect evidence of an increased heterotrophic capacity in native deep-water transplants (from the 'Deep Slope' habitat). Similar photo-acclimatisation potential was observed between transplants originating from the two shallow habitats ('Back Reef' and 'Upper Slope'), highlighting that their genetic segregation over depth may be due to other, non-photo-physiological traits under selection.

CONCLUSIONS:This study confirms that the observed habitat partitioning of S. hystrix (and associated Symbiodinium) is reflective of adaptive divergence along a depth gradient. Gene flow appears to be reduced due to divergent selection, highlighting the potential role of ecological mechanisms, in addition to physical dispersal barriers, in the diversification of scleractinian corals and their associated Symbiodinium.},

Here, we examine the influence of a range of environmental variables on the distribution of Symbiodinium associated with Acropora millepora collected from 47 coral reefs spanning 1,400 km on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:The environmental data included Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data at 1 km spatial resolution from which a number of sea surface temperature (SST) and water quality metrics were derived. In addition, the carbonate and mud composition of sediments were incorporated into the analysis along with in situ water quality samples for a subset of locations. Analyses were conducted at three spatio-temporal scales [GBR (regional-scale), Whitsunday Islands (local-scale) and Keppel Islands/Trunk Reef (temporal)] to examine the effects of scale on the distribution patterns. While SST metrics were important drivers of the distribution of Symbiodinium types at regional and temporal scales, our results demonstrate that spatial variability in water quality correlates significantly with Symbiodinium distribution at local scales. Background levels of Symbiodinium types were greatest at turbid inshore locations of the Whitsunday Islands where SST predictors were not as important. This was not the case at regional scales where combinations of mud and carbonate sediment content coupled with SST anomalies and mean summer SST explained 51.3% of the variation in dominant Symbiodinium communities.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Reef corals may respond to global-scale stressors such as climate change through changes in their resident symbiont communities, however, management of local-scale stressors such as altered water quality is also necessary for maintenance of coral-Symbiodinium associations.},

Summary: Measure of uptake by different types of symbionts in coral adults and persistent of these types 

Question: Can corals take up heterologous symbionts?

Methods:
infected bleached Porites divaricata with novel symbionts and observed recovery

Results:
The corals were able to temporarily acquire symbionts from the water column from heterologous symbionts
But "Only those symbiont types present before bleaching were stable upon recovery, demonstrating that recovery was from the resident in situ symbiont populations."
**"This is the first study to demonstrate that scleractinian corals have the ability to acquire exogenous Symbiodinium." (although the new associations were unstable)**

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Coral reefs worldwide are in decline. Much of the mortality can be attributed to coral bleaching (loss of the coral's intracellular photosynthetic algal symbiont) associated with global warming. How corals will respond to increasing oceanic temperatures has been an area of extensive study and debate. Recovery after a bleaching event is dependent on regaining symbionts, but the source of repopulating symbionts is poorly understood. Possibilities include recovery from the proliferation of endogenous symbionts or recovery by uptake of exogenous stress-tolerant symbionts.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:To test one of these possibilities, the ability of corals to acquire exogenous symbionts, bleached colonies of Porites divaricata were exposed to symbiont types not normally found within this coral and symbiont acquisition was monitored. After three weeks exposure to exogenous symbionts, these novel symbionts were detected in some of the recovering corals, providing the first experimental evidence that scleractinian corals are capable of temporarily acquiring symbionts from the water column after bleaching. However, the acquisition was transient, indicating that the new symbioses were unstable. Only those symbiont types present before bleaching were stable upon recovery, demonstrating that recovery was from the resident in situ symbiont populations.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:These findings suggest that some corals do not have the ability to adjust to climate warming by acquiring and maintaining exogenous, more stress-tolerant symbionts. This has serious ramifications for the success of coral reefs and surrounding ecosystems and suggests that unless actions are taken to reverse it, climate change will lead to decreases in biodiversity and a loss of coral reefs.},

Summary: Investigated the effect of UV on photosynthesis and cell performance in Symbiodinium from temperate and tropical host species.

Question: How does UV affect Symbiodinium in culture and in hospite? 

Methods:

Results: Found differences in the two types they looked at (temperate and tropical)
Size - not affected in either
Growth rates - significantly reduced in temperate spp, but not tropical
Synthesis of chlorophyll - depressed in tropical but not temperate
Cell motility in culture - depressed in both
Morphological response - tropical (none), multiple-layered cell walls in temperate after 4 wks (disappearing after UV was removed)

Sutton and Hoegh-Guldberg 1990
The Biological Bulletin 178(2):175-186

Summary: Investigated the control of translocation between partners in symbiosis both in vitro and in vivo

Question:
Does in vivo translocation occur in a range of temperate invertebrates?
Is there evidence for host factor control of zooxanthellae processes (photosynthesis, metabolism, translocation of photosynthetic products?
What are the active components of host extracts that affect zooxanthellae processes?

Methods:

Results:
Temperate symbioses transfer comparable amounts of photosynthetic product over short time series to their host as tropical species

The effect of P. versipora extract on isolated zooxanthellae was studied. This extract caused zooxanthellae to divert photosynthetic products from lipid synthesis to the production of neutral compounds, principally glycerol, and these compounds were the predominant form of carbon detected extracellularly after incubating zooxanthellae in this extract.

Nested PCR is described and a protocol that has been shown to work well for the amplification of ribosomal genes in ascomycetes is described. It is claimed that DNA extracts of lichenized fungi, contrary to many other organism groups, are often contaminated by other fungi. This poses a problem due to the preferential amplification of short intron-lacking sequences over longer, intron-containing ones, particularly when extension time is limited. A simple protocol for optimizing and troubleshooting PCRs is presented.},

abstract = {The functional role of the bacterial organisms in the reef ecosystem and their contribution to the coral well-being remain largely unclear. The first step in addressing this gap of knowledge relies on in-depth characterization of the coral microbial community and its changes in diversity across coral species, space and time. In this study, we focused on the exploration of microbial community assemblages associated with an ecologically important Caribbean scleractinian coral, Porites astreoides, using Illumina high-throughput sequencing of the V5 fragment of 16S rRNA gene. We collected data from a large set of biological replicates, allowing us to detect patterns of geographical structure and resolve co-occurrence patterns using network analyses. The taxonomic analysis of the resolved diversity showed consistent and dominant presence of two OTUs affiliated with the order Oceanospirillales, which corroborates a specific pattern of bacterial association emerging for this coral species and for many other corals within the genus Porites. We argue that this specific association might indicate a symbiotic association with the adult coral partner. Furthermore, we identified a highly diverse rare bacterial 'biosphere' (725 OTUs) also living along with the dominant bacterial symbionts, but the assemblage of this biosphere is significantly structured along the geographical scale. We further discuss that some of these rare bacterial members show significant association with other members of the community reflecting the complexity of the networked consortia within the coral holobiont.

Summary: Investigated MAA production in 2 symbiodinium types

Question: Which (if any) symbionts produce MAA and transfer them to their host?

Methods: Exposed symbio in culture to UV and measured whether MAA were produced in the cells and released in to the medium 

Results:
Symbiodinium from Cassiopeia are synthesizing MAAs and transporting them to their host (but it doesn't appear that symbio in Anthopleura are doing the same thing)

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Massively parallel sequencing allows for rapid sequencing of large numbers of sequences in just a single run. Thus, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing of complex microbial communities has become possible. The sequenced 16S rRNA fragments (reads) are clustered into operational taxonomic units and taxonomic categories are assigned. Recent reports suggest that data pre-processing should be performed before clustering. We assessed combinations of data pre-processing steps and clustering algorithms on cluster accuracy for oral microbial sequence data.

RESULTS:The number of clusters varied up to two orders of magnitude depending on pre-processing. Pre-processing using both denoising and chimera checking resulted in a number of clusters that was closest to the number of species in the mock dataset (25 versus 15). Based on run time, purity and normalized mutual information, we could not identify a single best clustering algorithm. The differences in clustering accuracy among the algorithms after the same pre-processing were minor compared with the differences in accuracy among different pre-processing steps.

Replicate coral nubbins of Stylophora pistillata and Porites cylindrica from the GBR were exposed to either 28 ^oC (control) or 32 ^oC for 5 days before being returned to an ambient reef temperature (28 ^oC). S. pistillata was found to contain either Symbiodinium genotype C1 or C8a, while P. cylindrica had type C15 based on ITS genotyping. Analysis of the quantum yield of photosystem (PS) II fluorescence of the symbionts in P. cylindrica showed that light-induced excitation pressure on the C15 Symbiodinium was significantly less, and the steady state quantum yield of PSII fluorescence at noon (DF/Fm') greater, than that measured in C1/C8a Symbiodinium sp. from S. pistillata. Immunoblots of the PS II D1 protein were significantly lower in Symbiodinium from S. pistillata compared to those in P. cylindrica after exposure to thermal stress. The biochemical markers, heat stress protein (HSP) 70 and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were significantly greater in P. cylindrica before the experiment, and both species of coral increased their biosynthesis of HSP 70 and SOD when exposed to thermal stress. Concentrations of MAAs, glycerol, and lipids were not significantly affected by thermal stress in these experiments, but DNA damage was greater in heat stressed S. pistillata compared to P. cylindrica There was minimal coral mucus, which accounts for up to half of the total energy budget of a coral and provides the first layer of defense for invading microbes, produced by S. pistillata after heat stress compared to P. cylindrica. It is concluded that P. cylindrica contains a heat resistant C15 Symbiodinium and critical host proteins are present at higher concentrations than observed for S. pistillata, the combination of which provides greater protection from bleaching conditions of high temperature in the light.},

This requires understanding patterns of coral's susceptibility to thermal stress and how coral communities will change with the environmental variables associated with climate change. This study combined surface currents, wind velocity, sea surface temperature (SST), UV radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and chlorophyll-a concentration for the western Indian Ocean and known relationships with coral bleaching and mortality to derive predictor variables that correlate with thermal stress. SST variability, UV, maximum temperature and wind speed had the highest influence on susceptibility estimates. Two susceptibility models were developed using Spatial Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) and cosine amplitude-AHP methods and a fuzzy logic technique for integrating environmental variables into a measure of susceptibility. Susceptibility models identified regional gradients in environmental stress, with the north-western Indian Ocean and some central Indian Ocean Islands as high and the southern African coastline and islands east of Madagascar as low vulnerability regions. Half of the strictly no take zones in the region are situated in locations with medium to high susceptibility. Future studies using high-resolution data can better estimate the vulnerability of specific locations and the establishment of marine protected areas where coral reef diversity is more likely to persist through climate change.},

abstract = {Faecal pollution contains a rich and diverse community of bacteria derived from animals and humans, many of which might serve as alternatives to the traditional enterococci and Escherichia coli faecal indicators. We used massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize microbial communities from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent sewage from 12 cities geographically distributed across the USA. We examined members of the Clostridiales, which included the families Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae for their potential as sewage indicators. Lachnospiraceae was one of the most abundant groups of faecal bacteria in sewage, and several Lachnospiraceae high-abundance sewage pyrotags occurred in at least 46 of 48 human faecal samples. Clone libraries targeting Clostridium coccoides (C. coccoides) in sewage samples demonstrated that Lachnospiraceae-annotated V6 pyrotags encompassed the previously reported C. coccoides group. We used oligotyping to profile the genus Blautia within Lachnospiraceae and found oligotypes comprised of 24 entropy components that showed patterns of host specificity. These findings suggest that indicators based on Blautia might have the capacity to discriminate between different faecal pollution sources. Development of source-specific alternative indicators would enhance water quality assessments, which leads to improved ecosystem health and reduced human health risk due to waterborne disease.

abstract = {Corals of genus Mussismilia (Mussidae) are one of the oldest extant clades of scleractinians. These Neogene relicts are endemic to the Brazilian coast and represent the main reef-building corals in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SAO). The relatively low-diversity/high-endemism SAO coralline systems are under rapid decline from emerging diseases and other local and global stressors, but have not been severely affected by coral bleaching. Despite the biogeographic significance and importance for understanding coral resilience, there is scant information about the diversity of Symbiodinium in this ocean basin. In this study, we established the first culture collections of Symbiodinium from Mussismilia hosts, comprising 11 isolates, four of them obtained by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). We also analyzed Symbiodinium diversity directly from Mussismilia tissue samples (N = 16) and characterized taxonomically the cultures and tissue samples by sequencing the dominant ITS2 region. Symbiodinium strains A4, B19, and C3 were detected. Symbiodinium C3 was predominant in the larger SAO reef system (Abrolhos), while Symbiodinium B19 was found only in deep samples from the oceanic Trindade Island. Symbiodinium strains A4 and C3 isolates were recovered from the same Mussismilia braziliensis coral colony. In face of increasing threats, these results indicate that Symbiodinium community dynamics shall have an important contribution for the resilience of Mussismilia spp. corals.},

The lipid content of tumor was 10.6% of the dry tissue weight, and was much lower than that for normal tissues (32.2%). The decrease in the total lipid content of tumorous tissue accompanied a reduced proportion of wax and triacylglycerol (TG).

Bulletin of Marine Science 69(1):79-109

Summary: Compared bleaching effects between 2 El Nino events

Question: How did the two El Nino events affect coral bleaching and mortality? What were background Symbiodinium types, and did they change?

Methods:
Visual census
RFLP

Results:
"The use of molecular DNA techniques to compare algal symbionts in bleached and healthy coral colonies revealed a strong correlation between bleaching severity and symbiont genotype, regardless of depth."
"In particular, one symbiont genotype (commonly found in the scleractinian genus Pocillopora in the Gulf of Chiriqui) was particularly resistant to bleaching, indicating that symbiont diversity can play an important role in explaining spatial and host systematic patterns of bleaching."
Gives species-specific symbio type associations for Pocillopora, P. lovata, P. Panamensis, P. damicornis, P. elegant, P inflata, M. intricata, Aiptasia
**Clade D is a heat-resistant Symbio type**
"Consequently, colonies containing only members of Symbiodinium C were severely affected by the ENSO warming, and were left with only remnant (but still detectable by PCR) populations of this genotype after bleaching. Colonies dominated by members of Symbiodinium C but with a low abundance of Symbiodinium D were also severely affected by bleaching, and were left with their (original) Symbiodinium D populations together with the remainder of the (expelled) Symbiodinium C. Colonies dominated by Symbiodinium D showed no visible bleaching and contained only this genotype after the bleaching event."
**Symbiont distributions can explain variability of bleaching response**
"However the potential role of stress history in increasing the resilience of coral reef ecosystems should not be ignored"

Problems:

Impressions: Weird - in Pocillopora they sampled, normal only had clade D, while bleached had C1 or C2+D. But in the Galapagos, ALL of their normal (non bleached) corals had clade C},

abstract = {The information that can be obtained from the secondary structure of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) is substantial, and yet many studies exploit this information inconsistently or inappropriately. This review introduces a remedy in the form of a flowchart where we detail the steps involved in estimating structure-based phylogenetic trees from ITS2 data. The pipeline described consists of the ITS2 Database, 4SALE, the CBCAnalyzer, and ProfDistS. Based on these tools, we describe how to utilize ITS2 sequence and secondary structure information together with an ITS2 specific scoring matrix and an ITS2 specific substitution model. The phylogenetic results thus obtained have been shown to be more reliable than approaches based on primary sequence data alone. Moreover, compensatory base changes (CBCs) in ITS2 sequence-structure pairs are identified as a possible marker for distinguishing species.},

Summary: "assessed the carbon acquisition and allocation in the tropical coral Stylophora pistillata, maintained under different conditions of auto- and heterotrophy" and ambient light conditions

Question: How does light and heterotrophy affect translocation of carbon between symbionts and corals?

Methods:
Lab tanks with coral nubbins
Calcification - buoyant weight technique
Determined heterotrophic feeding on nauplii
H13CO3 labelling
Factor: light level (low, high)
Heterotrophy (fed, unfed)
Response: calcification, translocation of carbon

Results:
"Using comprehensive measurements of the multiple pathways for carbon utilization within coral-dinoflagellate symbioses, this study demonstrates that the fate of photosynthetic carbon within coral symbioses depends critically on both irradiance and heterotrophic food availability."
Most translocation under high irradiance and food supply (why high food supply{\ldots}?) minimal for fed corals under low irradiance
"The coral holobiont, under high irradiance, instead relied on heterotrophic nutrients to increase the host tissue biomass."
"Under low irradiance, calcification is energetically limited and colonies therefore use heterotrophic carbon to fuel skeletal growth."

Problems:

Impressions: 
How do their "high" and "low" irradiance treatments correspond to natural light variability?},
